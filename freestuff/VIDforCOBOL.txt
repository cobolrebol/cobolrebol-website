VID for COBOL programmers

    Date written: 15-OCT-2015
    Date revised:  04-MAR-2019

    This is documentation for the REBOL Video Interface Dialect re-ordered
    in a way to accomplish two goals.  One goal is to get a person going right
    away writing programs.  The other goal is to provide a complete reference
    so a person can know all the possible things that can be done with VID.
    This is the same information provided in two documents on the REBOL web
    site, "Beginner's Guide to REBOL Visual Interfaces" and
    "REBOL/VIew/VID Developer's Guide." What this document offers is a slightly
    different angle of view.  If the documentation on the REBOL site seems
    confusing, try here for an alternate approach.  If this document seems 
    confusing, try the REBOL web site.  Everyone has a different paradigm in
    their heads.  A tutorial is very good for getting a person going fast,
    but not as good for a reference.  A reference is good for looking up
    things you have forgotten, but not as good for learning if you have no
    prior exposure. 

    Important note: The ultimate goal of this document would be a complete
    VID reference manual.  However, the official VID documentation seems
    to be incomplete.  In addition, some of the GUI concepts and operations
    are, shall we say, "outside the scope" of the authors' experience and
    understanding.  So this document was created by reading the official
    documentation plus the code for the graphical objects, and by 
    experimenting. The adjectives to describe this document might be
    "correct," "adequate," and "incomplete."  "Correct" means that nothing
    was put in that was not tested and found to be correct.  "Adequate"
    means that the document is complete enough so a person can use it to
    write VID program and use all the VID styles.  "Incomplete" means
    that things that could not be understood or made to work were left out
    deliberately in the interest of a cleaner result.  

===The target audience and references 

The target audience for this document is someone in one of the following
groups.

*Those who know REBOL already and want to know what GUI capabilities 
are available.  Note that important point, that you know REBOL already
and are interested in branching out of the basics into GUI programming.

*Those who like a more "reference manual" style of documentation instead
of a more "tutorial" style.

When you read the official VID documentaion, you will spot things like,
"VID can make various window items such as..." followed by a list of
things VID can do, but it doesn't really say that this is all the things
it can do.  Or, you might see something that says some feature is explained
in some other document, and be unable to find that other document.
This document tries to rework the main VID documents
into a form that says, this is VID, this is all of VID, this is what VID 
can do, and this is how you do it.  

However, since this document is based on existing VID documentation, it is 
NOT going to accomplish the above goals.  It can't provide any new 
information.  What it can do is present what documentation is available
and what information can be discovered into a reference-manual-like
format that can provide a stable platform for writing REBOL GUI programs.
What "stable platform" means is that you can use it to find quickly
if VID can do something and how to do it, without having to hunt around
and experiment.  It also means that you can pretend that this is the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth about VID.  Of course
this is not true, but because this document contains only stuff we
can find and verify, you can pretend it is a complete manual.
That is useful because having a manual you can use handily and trust
makes writing programs faster because you can reduce the trial and
error.   

Since the goal of this document is to complement existing documentation
and not to replace it or compete with it, you really should go to the
REBOL web site, click the "Documents" links at the top, look for the
link to REBOL 2 documentation, and see what is there.  You also should
read some very detailed instruction material by a well-known REBOL
programmer who has used REBOL for real live money-making enterprises
(which shows, by the way, that REBOL can be used for real live
applications).  The following documents are almost in the category of
"required reading."

And finally, there is a web site for REBOL programmers that contains a lot
of sample programs.  It would be redundant to mention them here, so you
should go there and look around.  A few are mentioned, however, at the end
of this document to point out that REBOL/View and the Video Interface 
Dialect have a lot more capability than is obvious from reading this
document.

===The really really basic basic overview overview

GUI in REBOL is done by describing windows in the program code, using
various keywords and values.  It does not use a drag-and-drop
style of screen building.  It uses language, because that is one of the
design goals of REBOL's creator. 

There are keywords for the various things you might want to put on a
window, like buttons and fields.

Where relevant, items on a window can be given names, so that attributes
of those items can be referred to in program code.  For example, a field
can have a name, and then one would use that name to refer to the contents
of the field, or maybe to set a value in the field. 

There are other keywords to modify the appearance of things on a window,
like its color, size, or maybe font size if the item is text.  

There are keywords to control the positioning of things on a window
if you don't want the default top-to-bottom left-to-right placement.

All these keywords are put into a code structure like this:
    view layout [
        (screen-description-keywords)
    ]

This document tries to describe all those screen description keywords,
in an orderly manner that should seem familiar to someone who has read
programming reference manuals.  

This "manual" as it were can't be quite like a traditional language 
reference manual because some of the syntax elements of a traditional
manual are not compatible with documentation on the internet (like the
less-than/greater-than angle brackets) or are already claimed as part
of the REBOL syntax (like the square brackets and the curly braces).
So we will have to make do with what we have and hope that context
makes things clear.

===Preparation for using this documentation

This document will have a lot of examples, but it will not show the output
of the examples.  The reason for that is that documentation with images is
harder to maintain.  Therefore, if you want to see the output of examples,
you should read this document on a computer with REBOL/View present.  
Installation is optional.  Then you can create a test script, paste the       
examples into it, and run them.  More specifically:

---Get REBOL/View running on your computer

Download it from the www.rebol.com.  It comes as an executable.
When you first run it, it will ask if you want to install it.
The recommended procedure is to do so, because if you do, then testing will
be easier.  You will be able to double-click a script file and run it.
If you don't install, then put the executable somewhere convenient. 

---Set up a test area

Exactly how you do this is up to you, but here is an idea.  
Put the REBOL executable into some folder somwehere.  If you installed
it, and you use Windows, it will be in "C:\Program Files (x86)\rebol\view"
but we won't use that as an example because if you use Windows 7 there
might be some security fussing you would have to do to get permission
in place test scripts in that area. Of course you could have the REBOL
interpreter in one place and your test scripts in another, but this is
supposed to be a simple example to use as a basis for something else
of your own choosing. For the sake of example, let's say the test area
is a folder called "C:\REBOLtest." 

This folder also will be where you place REBOL scripts that you will be
testing.  Keep in mind that if you installed REBOL you will be able to
run scripts by just double-clicking them, but in either case, installed
or not, you want to get things set up for running a test script.  
So do two things.

Make a test script.  This is a REBOL program into which you will paste
code from this document.  You will use the same script over and over,
pasting new code over the old.  Of course you don't <i>have to</i> do
it this way; this is just an idea.  The test script could be called
VIDtest.r and could look like this:
    REBOL [
        Title: "VID test harness"
    ]
    ;; Paste test code below this line and run this script. 
    view layout [
        banner "test"
    ]
The other step would be to make it easy to run the test script. 
For Windows, a simple idea is to make a DOS batch file to run it.
It could look like this:
    C:\REBOLtest\rebol.exe -i -s --script %VIDtest.r
The "-i" switch means don't install REBOL.  The "-s" switch means
don't give a security check message.  The "--script" switch identifies
the script you want to run.  This script name could be a full path
name to a script in some other folder.  

Put this DOS batch file in the test area.  Give it name, maybe 
something like "VIDtest.bat."  When you have made that DOS batch file,
test it by double-clicking it.  REBOL should run and produce a little
window in the upper left corner of the monitor.  If it works, you are
ready to test examples.  Examples will be given without the REBOL header.
You will open VIDtest.r in a text editor, paste in test code in the
indicated spot, save the file, double-click the batch file and see
the results.  If some test program is an example you want to save,
you could use the "save as" feature of the text editor to save that
version of VIDtest.r under a different name and then re-open VIDtest.r
to continue testing other code.

Alternatively, if the above is too fussy, you can run the REBOL
interpreter, activate its command console, and, to test your scripts,
enter the command
    do %VIDtest.r
Then, when you are done viewing the results, close the test window, 
not the command console.  For the next test, you will be able to go
to the command console and press the up-arrow key, the "do" command
will reappear, press "enter" to run the test again.  

---Possible problems

With Windows 7, problems of an unknown nature have been experienced
if files are not on the local computer, but are on, perhaps, a network
drive.  Also, REBOL 2 is a 32-bit program, and so on Windows 7 it might
be necessary to locate some option for "32-bit mode" or something like
that.  Unfortunately, REBOL 2 is not under development anymore, so if
you get some strange error you are a bit on your own for fixing it.
All examples in this document have been run on at least one computer
running Windows 7.  One would expect no problems with Windows XP.
For GNU/Linux, you would write a one-line shell script similar to the
DOS batch file and might have to do a bit of fussing with permissions.
As for Macintosh, the author of this document does not have easy
access to a Macintosh.  Theoretically, things should work.  The Crossover
Office product is not "free as in beer" but does not cost much, and is
an idea for using REBOL on Macintosh.  
  
===Overview of doing windows in REBOL

A REBOL program (as well a program in other interpreted languages
like Python) is referred to as a "script" because it is a file of
instructions that are executed starting at the beginning of the
script and proceeding to the end, generally.  So what do you do if
you want the script to display a window?  What you do is use syntax
in the language to define the window and the things on it, and then
later in the script perform a function to display that window.
The Video Interface Dialect (VID) is that syntax used to define a
window.

---Putting a window on the screen

The VID code that defines a window is a bunch of keywords (like
"button") and attributes (like "red") that define the items in the
window.  There also are other key words for positioning the window
items.  These keywords and attributes are written in a block, that is,
inside square brackets, and then passed to a function (the "layout"
function) to transform them into a displayable entity.  Then that
displayable entity is displayed with another function (the "view"
function).  That's why you see in the examples something like this:
    view layout [
        button red
    ]
The block that contains the syntax of "button red" is the VID code.
That block is passed to the "layout" function to make the window,
which then is passed to the "view" function to show the window. 

Code like the above example, where the window is defined, created,
and displayed, in practically one line of code, is how a lot of
examples are done, for conciseness.  In real life one might want
to organize the code a bit more, and do something like this:
    MAIN-WINDOW: layout [
        button red
    ]
    view MAIN-WINDOW
One could go even further, like this:
    MAIN-WINDOW-CODE: [
        button red
    ]
    MAIN-WINDOW: layout MAIN-WINDOW-CODE
    view MAIN-WINDOW
but you don't often see that.  Sometimes too much "organization"
is just too much.

---Making the window items do stuff

An item on a window is made to do something when "clicked" by putting
a block of code after its definition, like this:
    view layout [
        button red [print "clicked"]
    ]
That block of code can be anything.  More specifically, it can be a
lot of code, so often, to keep things organized, one might code it
like this:
    BUTTON-CODE: does [
        print "clicked"
    ]
    view layout [
        button red [BUTTON-CODE]
    ]
What this means is that when you click the red button you call the
function BUTTON-CODE to do something.  This technique can tidy up
the code so you can put all your button functions in one area, all
your windows in another area, and have the layout code easier to
read by the absence of all the procedure code.  But none of that
organizaional stuff is necessary.  

---Getting data from a window

A window is an interface with a person, and one common operation of
that interface is to get data entered by a person.  This is done by
giving the screen items names, and referring to those names, in
various ways depending on the kind of window item.  For example,
for a simple field, you could have this:
    view layout [
        FIELD-1: field 100
    ]
FIELD-1 (note the colon) is the name of the field.  With that name,
you now can refer to the contents of the field.  The exact syntax
for doing that varys with the kind of window item.  For a field,
there is a function to get its value.  For example:
    view layout [
        FIELD-1: field 100 [print get-face FIELD-1]
    ]
Notice that you can have a code block attached to a field.  
What this means is that when you press the "enter" key after
entering data, the code block will be executed.  The code block
gets the value of FIELD-1 by means of the "get-face" function 
which requires the name of the field as an argument.  You also can
do other things with the values of fields and similar data entry items.
You could copy them from the window, print them, build html pages
with them, store them in database or files, and so on.  

---Positioning items in windows

A design philosophy of REBOL is to make simple things easy and
complicated things possible.  In the area of making windows, how 
this is expressed is that in the layout block, you can just code the
things you want on the window, that is, buttons, fields, etc., and
REBOL will put them there in a reasonable way.  If you don't like
that way, then you can do something more complicated like specifying
exactly where you want them, with appropriate keywords.  
The default way of positioning items is to put one below the other.
Of course that can't go on forever, so you can cause the positioning
to go back to the top of the window and start a second column, with
the positioning keyword of "return."  For example:
    view layout [
        button "button 1"
        button "button 2"
        button "button 3"
        return
        button "button 4"
        button "button 5"
        button "button 6"
    ]

If you don't like the default arrangement and prefer the "left to
right top to bottom" way, you can invoke that with the keyword
"across" near the top of the layout code.  Then the "return"
keyword will create a new row instead of a new column.
For example:
    view layout [
        across
        button "button 1"
        button "button 2"
        button "button 3"
        return
        button "button 4"
        button "button 5"
        button "button 6"
    ]
There is a keyword to explicitly specify the default positioning.
That keyword is "below."  If you like to specify every detail,
including the default ones, you would put "below" in place of
"across" in the above example.

There are other keywords to affect positioning.  The above two
are presented to show the concept.  The othe keywords will be
presented later.  The concept is that you use keywords to control
positioning.  
   
===VID terminology

REBOL has its terminology for the items on windows, and we should
use it in the interest of all speaking the same language.  This
terminology is explained in the official VID documentation on the
REBOL web site. In brief:

---Keyword

The words like "above" and "below" explained previously, used to
control positioning on the layout, are called "keywords."

---Style

An item on a window is called, generally, an "interface object"
or "face" for short.  All these objects inherit various characteristics
from a "master face" 
to make them similar and have their own characteristics to make them
different.  In other words, any item on the screen, like a button or
a field, is a different style of an interface object.  So, the term
used for the words that identify things in a window is "style."
For example, the word "button" is a "style" of interface object,
or a "style" for short.

---Face

As mentioned above, an item on a window is called an "interface object"
or "face" for short.  In "the literature" as it were, you will see
an item on a window referred to a "face" as well as a "style."
You also will see the entire window referred to as a "face."
It seems that all windows and window objects are descendents, so to
speak, of a master "face" object, which leads to the use of "face"
to refer to anything on a window. 

---Facet

Any style on a window can have an assortment of attributes.
For example, a button can have a color, a field can have a length.
The words that indicate these attributes are called "facets."
So the coding of "button red" means that on the window there is
a red button, or, a button "style" with a color facet of "red."

---Variable

Any style on a window can have a name attached so that you can refer
to it in the code.  This name is called a "variable."  In the earlier
example of "FIELD-1: field 100" there is a field "style" with a 
length "facet" of 100 pixels, named for later reference
with the "variable" of "FIELD-1." 

---Styledef

It is possible (a bit more advanced topic) to define custom styles.
For example, there is syntax to define a red button so that instead
of always having to code "button red" you could code a shorthand
for that.  This syntax is called a "styledef" and is a topic 
deferred to the advanced section of VID usage.

A nomenclature change can be a nuisance.  In the beginning, just
remember that the things in a window are called "styles" and
their attributes are called "facets."  

===Overview of all styles (the things you put on windows) 

\note This is just an overview

This section is just an overview of all the items you can put on
a window.  It is not the details.  The details are later.

/note 

This section shows, by example, all the styles that are available.
In other words, these are all the things you can put into a
window.  They are presented in code examples for you to try.
These are not functioning examples except for the fact that the
code does run and produce a window.  The purpose of these 
examples is to inform you of all the things (styles) that are
available for constructing a GUI interface.  There is only enough
other code to make the window work (that is, appear on the screen). 

\note Might want to adjust your test harness...

In the example below, and in all following examples, the 
"view layout [" and the ending square bracket at the end of the
layout are omitted.  This saves just two lines of code per example,
but over hundred of examples this is hundreds of lines.
You might want to adjust your test script to include those lines,
so that you can paste the following examples between those lines.  

/note

To assist in running the examples, you could copy and save the 
following program.  Then, when you want to test one of the examples,
you still would copy it to the clipboard, but instead of pasting it
into your test harness, you would just double-click the following
program which you saved somewhere.  What this program does is
"load" the clipboard, which turns the clipboard contents into a 
REBOL block.  Then it feeds that block to the "layout" function
and "view"s the resulting window.

    REBOL [
        Title: "Run clipboard VID example"
    ]
    VID-CLIP: load clipboard://
    view center-face layout VID-CLIP

Some of the examples below require code outside the layout code.
For those, you will have to paste them under just a REBOL header
and not inside a layout block.  To assist in running those, you
could save the following program to a name of your choosing, and
then copy the code samples to the clipboard and run the program 
below.  What this program does is, again, load the contents of
the clipboard to a block, and then run that block as if it were
a REBOL program (which is it).  This is an example of how REBOL
mixes code and data.  The data read from the clipboard is code,
the "load" function brings it in as a block, and the "do" function
executes it. 

    REBOL [
        Title: "Run clipboard VID example"
    ]
    VID-CLIP: load clipboard://
    do VID-CLIP 

The following styles were obtained by interrogating the REBOL
intperpreter itself, using a script from Carl's blog.
The script is:
    foreach [name obj] system/view/vid/vid-styles [
        print [name "-" obj/doc/info]
    ]
You can paste above code into a script of your own to save for
future use, or you can paste it into the REBOL console and run
it for immediate results.

Here is a script to make a window using each one of these, so 
you can see generally what they look like.  Remember to paste it
between an opening line of "view layout [" and and ending line
of "]". Logically, this is one script, however, because there are
so many styles and monitor sizes can vary, the code is broken
down into several scripts so the generated window doesn't overflow
the physical screen size. 

Here are styles that are generally used for decorating the window,
that is, pictures, labels, text.  The first word of each line is
the style.  What follows each style is enough facets to show what
the style looks like. 
    banner "banner: Banner text"

    bar
    icon
    logo-bar 40x100
    led
    arrow 
    progress 300x16 
    
Here are styles that are generally used for entering data or making
things happen.
    button 
    field 100 
    area 100x60 
    text-list data ["item 1" "item 2"] 
    list 200x50 [across text 80 text 80] data [
        ["item 1-1" "item 1-2"] 
        ["item 2-1" "item 2-2"]
    ]
    return
    drop-down rows 5 "choice 1" "choice 2" "choice 3" "choice 4" "choice 5"
    rotary "choice 1" "choice 2" "choice 3" "choice 4" 
    choice "choice 1" "choice 2" "choice 3" "choice 4" 
    toggle "on" "off" 
    tog "on" "off"
    btn
    btn-enter
    btn-cancel
    btn-help 
    check
    check-mark
    check-line
    radio
    radio-line
    scroller 200x16
    slider 200x16

Here are two other styles that can be useful.
The "key" style doesn't really put anything on the window,
but defines a "hot key" so that if you press that key something
will happen.  The sensor defines an invisible area on the
window.  If the area is invisible, it is hard to hit it with a 
mouse.  So, you could give it a size of 0x0 and assign a hot key
to it, or you could make it really big so you can't miss it.
    key #"k" [print "k pressed"]
    sensor 100x100 [print "sensor activated"] 

There are two styles used for window backgrounds.  Here is the
one for using a scaled image as a background.  We have to include
some other items to make the window big enough to show the effect.

    backdrop http://www.rebol.com/graphics/reb-logo.gif
    box 500x16 red
    box 16x500 green

Here is the style for filling the background with a tiled image.

    backtile http://www.rebol.com/graphics/reb-logo.gif
    box 500x16 red
    box 16x500 green        
    
The above items are what you have available to create a visual interface.
The above lists are just summaries, to show all the possibilities.
Following chapters explain in detail how to use each one.

And finally there is a style for creating sub-layouts within layouts.
This is called "panel" and takes a block of VID code as an 
argument:
    view layout [
        panel 300x200 beige [
            button "button 1"
            button "button 2"
        ]
    ]

===Facets: The attributes of styles

\note Why we are explaining facets before styles

A later chapter is going to list all the styles
that you can put on a window.  For any style, you can specify
attributes ("facets" as explained in this chapter), AND, many if
not all the facets can apply to multiple styles.  That is the reason
that facets are explained first.  When you get to the explanations
of the styles, we can say that a style has a "text facet" and you
will know what that means, and we will not have to explain the 
"text facet" every time it occurs.

/note

As mentioned above, a GUI window is composed of styles of interface
objects, the buttons, fields, and so on.  In a GUI window, you are going
to want to specify attributes of these sytles, that is, things like
size, color, font.  Those attributes are specified by words called
"facets" written after the style name, like "button red" for a red
button.  In the chapter that describes styles in detail, it will be
necessary to indicate which facets can be used with a given style.
To make that easier, this chapter explains all the facets.  This is
similar to the railroad diagrams used to describe programming languages.
In other words, you might have something like:
    ---> button ---> (color-facet) ---
                 |------------------^
which would indicate that the word "button" could be followed by an
optional "color-facet" whatever that was.  The "color-facet" would be
defined elsewhere, so that its definition would not have to be repeated
for every situation where a colof-facet was called for. This chapter
defines all those facets, and these descriptions will be referred to 
in later chapters where relevant.

Two things complicate the following definitions.  Number one, it is 
hard to use the traditional angle brackets in an html document.
Number two, the traditional square brackets used in documentation to
indicate optional items can't be used clearly in REBOL documentation
because the square brackets are part of REBOL syntax.  In addition,
parentheses can be used in certain VID situations to indicate REBOL
code that is to be executed.  What we will do is use parentheses to
indicate things that are defined elsewhere, and if the item being
documented uses parentheses as part of its syntax, we will expalain 
that on a case-by-case basis.

---Size facet: Specifying the size of a style

Syntax: (horizontal-dimension)x(vertical-dimension)

Here is an example of our documentation difficulties and how we
are resolving them.  The above specification is not quite accurate.
The vertical dimension is optional, and if omitted, will be 
calculated automatically or given a default value.  So a more
correct specification would be
    (horizontal-dimenstion) [ x (vertical-dimension) ]
which indicates that the vertical dimenstion is optional.  But we
don't want to use the square brackets because they have meaning in
REBOL.  We could do this:
    ---> (horizontal-dimension) --|------------------------------>
                                  |--> x (vertical-dimension --|
but the problem with this method is the effort to draw it.  
Also, it must be confessed, there is a bit of mental effort in breaking
down things into the railroad diagram entities in the most useful way.
The primary goal of documentation is to make something people can understand
and use, and not necessarily to perform an exercise in logical purity,
unless the logical purity is necessary for adequate understanding.

The size facet is used in a number of places, such as button size,
field length, window dimenstions.  For example:
    box 50x50

---Text facet: Putting text on a style

Syntax: " (any-text) " or { (any-text) } 

The text facet is what you use to specify the text of a heading, or a
text field, or the label on a button, any text that appears anywhere.
You just type the text after the style name.  Optionally, you can use
a word as a text facet if that word refers to text from elsewhere.
For example:
    text "Sample text in a text area"
    text {This is a longer multi-line text item.  REBOL will make
        the required amount of space for it.}
You also could have coded something like
    text text-from-elsewhere
where text-from-elsewhere would be coded elsewhere in the program, maybe
like this:
    text-from-elsewhere: "Text to display on window"

You will see later that the text facet can be used in a surprising
number of places besides text fields and button labels.

---Color facet: Coloring a style

Syntax:  (red-value).(green-value).(blue-value) or (color-word)

The color facet is used to color many things.  The red-value, green-value,
and blue-value are numbers from 0 to 255 indicating the amount of each
color.  You also may use a predefined color.  the colors are (presented
in an example of colored boxes):
    across
    box 90x50 black      "black"
    box 90x50 coal       "coal"
    box 90x50 gray       "gray"
    box 90x50 pewter     "pewter"
    box 90x50 silver     "silver"
    box 90x50 snow       "snow"
    box 90x50 white      "white"
    box 90x50 blue       "blue"
    box 90x50 green      "green"
    box 90x50 cyan       "cyan"
    return
    box 90x50 red        "red"
    box 90x50 yellow     "yellow"
    box 90x50 magenta    "magenta"
    box 90x50 navy       "navy"
    box 90x50 leaf       "leaf"
    box 90x50 teal       "teal"
    box 90x50 maroon     "maroon"
    box 90x50 olive      "olive"
    box 90x50 purple     "purple"
    box 90x50 orange     "orange"
    return
    box 90x50 oldrab     "oldrab" 
    box 90x50 brown      "brown"  
    box 90x50 coffee     "coffee" 
    box 90x50 sienna     "sienna" 
    box 90x50 crimson    "crimson"
    box 90x50 violet     "violet" 
    box 90x50 brick      "brick"  
    box 90x50 pink       "pink"   
    box 90x50 gold       "gold"   
    box 90x50 tan        "tan"    
    return
    box 90x50 beige      "beige"  
    box 90x50 ivory      "ivory"  
    box 90x50 linen      "linen"  
    box 90x50 khaki      "khaki"  
    box 90x50 rebolor    "rebolor"
    box 90x50 wheat      "wheat"  
    box 90x50 aqua       "aqua"   
    box 90x50 forest     "forest" 
    box 90x50 water      "water"  
    box 90x50 papaya     "papaya" 
    return
    box 90x50 sky        "sky"    
    box 90x50 mint       "mint"   
    box 90x50 reblue     "reblue" 
    box 90x50 base-color "base-color"        
    box 90x50 yello      "yello"  
    return

If you don't like the predefined colors and want to create your own
with a color tuple, you can, at the REBOL console, enter the function
"request-color" to bring up a color requestor dialog window.
You operate three sliders for red, green, and blue, click the OK
button, and get back the color tuple for the color you created.

---Image facet: Putting a picture on a style

Syntax:  (Name-of-image-file) | (url-address-of-image-file) | (word-referring-to-image-file)

The image facet is how you get an image onto a style on a window.
In the most obvious situation, you have
    image %picture.jpg
In the above code, the word "image" is a style, namely, the "image"
style, and "%picture.jpg" is the image facet applied to that style,
in other words, an image that will be placed on that image style.
That might sound a bit confusing until you see
    button "test" %picture.jpg
in which case you will get a button with the text "test" printed on 
it AND the picture in the file picture.jpg as a background on the
button.  The image facet can be applied to some surprising things.

---Action facet: Making a style do something

Syntax:  [ (REBOL-code) ]

The action facet is a block, written after the style name, containing
REBOL code that is executed when you click on the style, or maybe, in
the case of the field style, press the "enter" key.  For example:
    button "Click" [print "Button pressed"]
In addition, you may provide a second action facet to be executed on
a right click:
    button "Click" [print "left"] [print "right"] 

The code in the action facet can be long. It might be more helpful
to put a function name in the block, and then define that function
elsewhere.  It is not required, but it will make the window layout
cleaner.  

---Character facet: Creating a shortcut key 

Syntax:  REBOL character code

A REBOL characer code is a pound sign followed by a character in 
quotes, as in:  #"t" for the letter "t." 

The character facet is a way to specify a single keystroke that will
be detected and interpreted as a mouse click.  It is like the
familiar shortcut keys in many window systems.  For example:
    button "test" #"t" [print "left"]

---Font facet block: Controlling font appearance

Syntax: font [ (font-attributes) ]

(font-attributes) is a block of word-value pairs. The word is one of the
items below with a colon after it.  The value depends on the word, as follows:

name: font-serif | fons-sans-serif | font-fixed

size: (integer)

style: none | [ bold | italic | underline ]

color: (color-tuple) | (color-word)

align: none | 'left | 'right | 'center

valign: 'top | 'bottom | 'middle

offset: (pair)

space: (pair)

shadow: none | (pair)

Explanation and default values:

name: This is a system-independent font family chosen from the values shown.
The default is font-sans-serif.

size: This is a point size value.  Default is 12.

style: If used, must be one of the indicated values. The values are 
specified in a block, however, if you want to use just one, like bold,
you may specify it without the square brackets but you must put the single
quote in front to make it a REBOl work, as in: style: 'bold.
Default is none.

color: You may make your own color with a color tuple, or use a pre-defined
REBOL color word.  Default is black.

align: This controls the horizontal alignment of the text within the size
of the are where the text is placed.  Note that the value must be a
REBOL word as indicated by the single quote in front of the left/right/middle
choice.  Default is left.

valign: This controls the vertical alignment, similar to the horizontal
alignment controlled by "align."  Default is top.

offset: It appears that this is supposed to be for positioning  text with more
control that just the align and valign options.  However, it does not seem
to work. 

space: This controls extra space, in pixels between letters, or between lines
of multi-line text.  Default is 0x0.  Values my be negative to compress
text.

shadow: This creates a shadow effect on the text, as if a light were 
shining on it from some direction.  Positive values project to the right and
negative to the left.  For the vertical direction, negative projects up
and positive down.  An example follows.

Example:
    text 600x100 "This is some test text set with all default values" 
        font [
            name: font-sans-serif
            size: 12
            style: none
            color: black
            align: none
            valign: none
            offset: 2x2
            space: 0x0
            shadow: none
        ]
    text 600x100 "This is text with all values non-defualt" 
        font [
            name: font-serif
            size: 24
            style: [bold italic underline]
            color: red
            align: 'center
            valign: 'middle
            offset: 10x10
            space: 4x4
            shadow: 4x4
        ]

Here is a special example to show the shadow only because of the
number of combinations.
    text "No shadow" font [size: 40 shadow: none]
    text "Right only" font [size: 40 shadow: 6x0 ]
    text "Left only" font [size: 40 shadow: -6x0 ]
    text "Up only" font [size: 40 shadow: 0x-6 ]
    text "Down only " font [size: 40 shadow: 0x6 ]
    text "Right and up" font [size: 40 shadow: 6x-6 ]
    text "Right and down" font [size: 40 shadow: 6x6 ]
    text "Left and up" font [size: 40 shadow: -6x-6 ]
    text "Left and down" font [size: 40 shadow: -6x6 ]

A note about the font facet concept:  It might be best not to think too hard
about this.  A "text" style is a graphical item on the window.  The actual
value of the text is the "facet."  The "font" facet is called a "facet,"
but if you follow out that definition and consider that the "font" facet is
applying to the actual text, which itself is a "facet" of the text "style,"
then you have the "font" facet being a facet of a facet.  Accept that desinging
a language probably is not an easy job when you get down to the actual details,
and that some logical purity might have slipped through the cracks.

---Edge facet block: Framing a style 

Syntax: edge [ (edge-attributes) ]

(edge-attributes) is a block of work-value pairs.  The word is one of the 
items with a colon after it.  The value depends on the word, as follows:

size:  (pair)

color: (color-tuple) | (color-word) 

effect:  'bevel | 'ibevel | 'bezel | 'ibezel | 'nubs  

Explanation and default values:

size:  A pair, in pixels.  The x value is the thickness of the vertical edges,
and the y value of the horizontal.

color: Standard color tuple or word, for the color of the edge.

effect: These are shown in the following examples.  Note that the official
VID documentation says the "effect"can be a block, but in actual practice
that does not work, and you must use the REBOL word to describe the
effect. 

Example:

    box 100x60 "bevel" edge [size: 10x10 color: red effect: [bevel]] 
    box 100x60 "ibevel" edge [size: 10x10 color: red effect: [ibevel]] 
    box 100x60 "bezel" edge [size: 10x10 color: red effect: [bezel]] 
    box 100x60 "ibezel" edge [size: 10x10 color: red effect: [ibezel]] 
    box 100x60 "nubs" edge [size: 10x10 color: red effect: [nubs]] 
    return
    box 100x60 "bevel" edge [size: 10x10 color: green effect: 'bevel]
    box 100x60 "ibevel" edge [size: 10x10 color: green effect: 'ibevel]
    box 100x60 "bezel" edge [size: 10x10 color: green effect: 'bezel]
    box 100x60 "ibezel" edge [size: 10x10 color: green effect: 'ibezel]
    box 100x60 "nubs" edge [size: 10x10 color: green effect: 'nubs] 

---Para facet block: Formatting text paragraphs

Syntax:  para [ (paragraph-attributes) ]

(paragraph-attributes) is a block of word-value pairs.  The word is one of 
the items with a colon after it.  The value depends on the word, as follows:

origin: (pair)

margin: (pair)

indent: (pair)

scroll: (pair)

tabs: (integer) | (block of integers)

wrap?: true | false 

Explanation and default values:

origin: An offset in pixels from the upper left corner of the style
that contains the text. Default is 2x2.

margin:  This is an offset for the right and the bottom of the
text in a face (a style).  It is like a "buffer zone" to keep
the text a certain number of pixels from the right and the
bottom of the face.  It is not obvious of the text is too
big for what holds it, but an example below shows how it
works.  Default is 2x2. 

indent:  The x part of the pair is the offset of the first line of
a paragraph, that is, the number if pixels by which the first line
is indented.  The y part is the number of pixels between paragraphs.
Default is 0x0.

scroll: An offset, left-right and up-down, of the text in within the
style.  This attribute usually is change dynamically to control
scrolling of text in a style.  You change the x or y value, and then
re-display the style, and the text is moved.  Default is 0x0.

tabs:  This is a single number, or a block of numbers, for setting
tab stops inside a style that can contain text.  Default is 40 for
tab stops every 40 pixels.  

wrap?:  This is a true/false value that controls whether or not text
in a face (style) will be wrapped, or just run off to the right.
Default is false.

Example follows.  Note that this example includes the "view layout" line
because of the need for some test text.  This text is just something copied
from an internet news story.  There are two paragraphs, separated by
pressing the "enter" key.  If the "enter" key doesn't make it through all
the layers of the internet, you might have to type it manually after
"U.S Army Recruiting Command."  It is possible that you also will have to
re-type the text to eliminate line-feeds after all lines except the one
where you want the paragraphs to separate.  Otherwise, every line of text
will be its own paragrpah.  
    TEST-TEXT: {In about five years, so many young Americans will be grossly 
    overweight that the military will be unable to recruit enough qualified 
    soldiers. That alarming forecast comes from Maj, Gen. Allen Batschelet, 
    who is in charge of U.S. Army Recruiting Command.
    Of the 195,000 young men and women who signed up to fight for our country, 
    only 72,000 qualified. Some didn't make the cut because they had a 
    criminal background, or a lack of education, or too many tattoos. 
    But a full 10% didn't qualify because they were overweight.}
    view layout [
    area 100x200 TEST-TEXT
    area 100x200 TEST-TEXT para [
        origin: 2x2
        margin: 2x2
        indent: 0x0
        scroll: 0x0
        tabs: 40
        wrap?: false
    ]
    area 100x200 TEST-TEXT para [
        origin: 20x20
        wrap?: true
    ]
    return
    area 300x200 TEST-TEXT para [
    margin 20x20
    indent: 20x20
    wrap?: true 
    ]  
    area 300x200 TEST-TEXT para [
    indent: 20x20
    wrap?: true
    scroll: -30x-30 
    ] 
    ]

Here is an example to show just the tab attribute.  In the string in
the code, the words in the string are separated by a single tab.
If the tab character didn't make it through all the layers to get to
your example, you might have to re-type the TEST-TEXT line and
place a single tab after aatab, bbtab, and cctab.  That is done as
you might imagine, by pressing the "tab" key on the keyboard.
Note that this example includes the "view layout" line because there
is a line of code outside of the layout, needed to create the
example.
    TEST-TEXT: {aatab	bbtab	cctab} ;; single tab between words
    view layout [
    area 700x100 TEST-TEXT para [
        origin: 2x2
        margin: 2x2
        indent: 0x0
        scroll: 0x0
        tabs: 100
        wrap?: false
    ]
    area 700x100 TEST-TEXT para [
        origin: 2x2
        margin: 2x2
        indent: 0x0
        scroll: 0x0
        tabs: [150 350 550]
        wrap?: false
    ]
    ]

Here is an example of just the margin.  As above, you almost certainly
will have to re-type the text so that it is two long lines with a 
line feed after "U.S Army Recruiting Command."  What you will see then 
will be two text areas with two paragraphs of text.  The margin feature
will not be obvious because the text is too big for the boxes, but,
if you put the mouse pointer into each box and use the down arrow to
move to the bottom of each area, you will see the 20-pixel buffer
at the bottom of the second box. 
    TEST-TEXT: {In about five years, so many young Americans will
    be grossly overweight that the military will be unable to recruit 
    enough qualified soldiers. That alar    ming forecast comes from 
    Maj, Gen. Allen Batschelet, who is in charge 
    of U.S. Army Recruiting Command.
    Of the 195,000 young men and women who signed up to fight for our 
    country, only 72,000 qualified. Some didn't make the cut because 
    they had a criminal background, or a lack of education, or too

    overweight.}
    view layout [
    area 300x200 TEST-TEXT para [
        origin: 2x2
        margin: 2x2
        indent: 20x20
        scroll: 0x0
        tabs: 40
        wrap?: true 
    ]

        tabs: 40
        wrap?: true 
    ]
    ]

---Feel facet block: Advanced look and feel

Advanced "look and feel" operations are a bit outside the scope of
this document, which is intended to cover enough of the basic VID
features to do useful things.  REBOL has the ability to do many
fancier things, like detecting mouse-overs, responding to timers 
for animation, having windows modify themselves before being displayed.
Someone interested in that should read:

<a href="http://www.rebol.com/docs/view-system.html">
REBOL/View Graphic System Reference</a>

<a href="http://www.rebol.com/how-to/feel.html">
How to Handle User Interface Events</a>

In summary, the "feel" facet will be the keyword "feel" followed
by a block that contains functions for doing advanced things.
These functions are activated at various times in the processing of
a window.  

---Effect facet block: Decorating a backdrop

Syntax: effect [ (effect-attributes) ]

(effect-attributes) are words that indicate some processing to be 
done on the image you are "effecting."  This image can be the backdrop
of a whole window, or the backdrop on some item, like a button.
The block can contain any number of words, and the effects are applied
in order.  Some words require arguments, as indicated.

Because there are so many words, and any number can be used at one
time, the number of permutations is huge.  So examples of all combinations
is not reasonable possible.  In addition, the words are documented in
the REBOL/View VID Developer's Guide linked at the front of this document,
so reproducing that information here is not productive unless we have any
additional information to present.  The words are summarized below.
Effects are not necessary to provide functionality in your program; they
are for appearance.  You could experiment at your leisure while still
writing productive REBOL programs. 

As an idea for experimenting, find some picture for testing and put it
into your test area.  Then make a test script like this:
    size 600x480
    backdrop %TestImage.jpg
        effect [
            aspect
    ]
The code above creates a window 600 by 480 pixels and puts your picture
into the background.  The single specified effect, "aspect," preserves the
"aspect ratio" so that the picture looks correct.  When you have this test
script ready, add more effect words after (or in place of) "aspect" and
see what happens.  

(effect-attributes) in summary:  (Note that these are not name-value pairs
like in, for example, the para effect.  The colon in the examples below
are just like you would us a colon normally and are not part of the VID
syntax.)

<b>fit:</b> Expand or shrink the image to fit the face.

<b>aspect:</b>  Expand or shrink the image to fit, and preserve aspect ratio.

<b>extend (offset-pair) (distance-pair):</b>  Extend an image by starting it 
at the location indicated by the offset-pair and extending it a number
of pixels in the x and y directions as indicated by the distance-pair.

<b>tile:</b>  Tile the image in it the face to which it is applied.

<b>tile-view</b>:

<b>clip:</b> Clip the image to fit the face.

<b>crop (offset-to-start-pair) (size-of-clip-pair):</b> Crop the image by starting
at an offset indicated by the first pair, and taking a cropping of a size
indicated by the second pair.

<b>flip (direction-pair):</b>  Flip the image as indicated by the direction-pair.
The direction-pair can be 1x0 for horizontal, 0x1 for vertical, 1x1 for both.

<b>rotate (degrees):</b> Rotate 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees as indicated by the
supplied number of degrees.

<b>reflect (direction-pair):</b> Reflect the image around an axis through the
middle of the image, either a horizontal axis or a vertical.  
The direction-pair can be 1x0, 0x1, or 1x1.

<b>invert:</b> Reverse the colors of the image, like making it into a negative. 

<b>luma (integer):</b> Lighten or darken the image based on the integer, which
may be positive or negative. 

<b>contrast (integer):</b> Increase or decrease the contrast. 

<b>tint (integer):</b> Change the tint based on the integer. 

<b>grayscale:</b> Make the image black and white.

<b>colorize (color-tuple)</b>:

<b>multiply (integer) | (color-tuple) | (image-file-name):</b> 

<b>difference (image-file-name):</b>

<b>blur:</b>

<b>sharpen:</b> 

<b>emboss:</b>

<b>gradient (pair) (color-tuple) (color-tuple):</b> 

<b>gradcol (pair) (color-tuple) (color-tuple):</b>

<b>gradmul (pair) (color-tuple) (color-tuple):</b>

<b>key (integer) | (color-tuple):</b> 

<b>shadow (integer) | (color-tuple):</b> 

<b>arrow (color-tuple) | (color-word):</b> Generates a big arrow on the underlying
face.  

<b>cross (color-tuple) | (color-word):</b> Generates a big cross on the underlying
face.

<b>oval (color-tuple) | (color-word):</b> Generates a big oval on the underlying
face.

<b>tab:</b> 

<b>grid (spacing-pair) (offset-pair) (thickness-pair) (color-tuple):</b> This puts a grid
on the face. The (spacing-pair) is the number of pixels between lines.
The (offset-pair) is an offset from the top left corner, if you don't want the
top left grid rectangle to start at the top left pixel.  The grid, however, will
go all the way to the edge.
The (thickness-pair) is the thickness of the lines in pixels.  
The (color-tuple) is the color of the grid lines (which might not work).

<b>draw [ (draw-dialect-block) ]:</b>  This allows you to draw custom stuff on the
face.  There is a special REBOL dialect for drawing that is beyond the scope
of this document.  Check this link:
<a href="http://www.rebol.com/docs/draw-ref.html">
REBOL/View Draw Dialect 1.3</a>

---Rate facet:  Timing things

Syntax:  rate (seconds) | (elapsed-time) 

seconds: An integer for a number of seconds.

elapsed-time: A time (hh:mm:ss) to wait between time interrupts.

It appears that the "rate" can be applied to any style, and a timer
interrupt will take place according to the time specified. 
Now, what to do with that interrupt.  This is a case where the "feel" facet
can be used.  The "engage" option in the "feel" facet catches the timer
interrupt.  This seems to be a somewhat common operation in REBOL.
Here is an example of how it works.
    box 200x200 red rate 00:00:01
        feel [
            engage: [
                print "interrupted"
            ]
        ] 
As for how to use it in a real situation, the "engage" function can
be quite involved.  This operation is at the heart of some of the clock
demos available on the internet.  If you set a rate of 1, meaning one second,
then, the engage function can, at that time, display the current time.
What this accomplishes is to refresh a display of the current time every
second, giving the appearance of a running clock. 

---Data facet: Loading data 

Syntax: data [ (data-block) ]

The (data-block) is a block of whatever data is appropriate for the stle
of face.  Data is not a concept that makes sense for all styles.
However, it appears you can load the data facet for all styles, it just
doesn't have any use outside of a style where it does have use.
A common use is the text list, as follows:  (Don't paste this inside a
layout block as you have done for other samples.) 
    LIST-DATA: [
        "text line 1"
        "text line 2"
        "text line 3"
    ]
    view layout [
        across
        text-list 200x300
            data LIST-DATA
    ]

---Pane facet: Making sub-layouts

There is a special style, and a special facet to go with it,
for making layouts within layouts.  The style is "panel" and the
facet is "pane," although one does not use the keyword "pane."
Instead, one supplies a block of VID code as an argument after
the "panel" keyword, as shown below:
    BUTTON-PANE: [
        size 196x396
        below
        button "Button 1" [print "Button 1"]
        button "button 2" [print "Button 2"]
        button "button 3" [print "Button 3"]
        button "button 4" [print "Button 4"]
        button "button 5" [print "Button 5"]
        button "button 6" [print "Button 6"]
        button "button 7" [print "Button 7"]
        button "button 8" [print "Button 8"]
        button "button 9" [print "Button 9"]
    ]
    view layout [
        across
        TEXT-INPUT: area 200x400
        CONTROL-BUTTONS: panel 200x400 beige 
            BUTTON-PANE     
            edge [size: 4x4 color: red effect: 'bevel]
        return
        button "Button 0" [print "Button 0"]
    ]

===Positioning items (styles), and other attributes 

\note Why we are explaining positioning here

As with facets, we are explaining how to position things on windows
before we explain what you actually CAN position on a window.
The reason for this is so that when we make examples of the various
styles, any positioning keywords we might need to make the examples
work will be familiar.

/note 

If you start writing the VID code, placing items on the window without
caring where they go, they will go in a default order which is top to
bottom, on into eternity.  To override that default placement, you use
various keywords, explained below.

---Below: The default positioning

If you specify the keyword "below" in the VID code, then from that point
on, a new style will be placed below the previously-defined one.
    below
    button "button 1"
    button "button 2"
    button "button 3"
You may leave off the word "below" if you like because that is the default.

---Return: Starting a new row (or column)

If you keep adding items to a window you will run out of room, so to
go back to the top, use the word "return."
    below
    button "button 1"
    button "button 2"
    button "button 3"
    return
    button "button 4"
    button "button 5"
    button "button 6"

---Across: Left-to-right positioning

If you prefer to think left-to-right first, you can use the word
"across" to make things go that way.  With "across," the "return"
keyword will start a new row instead of a new column.
    across 
    button "button 1"
    button "button 2"
    button "button 3"
    return
    button "button 4"
    button "button 5"
    button "button 6"

---At: Absolute positioning

If you don't want to take the automatic positioning, you can specify
exactly where to put things with the "at" keyword.  In the following
example, we will place 100-pixel boxes every 100 pixels.
    at 0x0     box  100x100 red
    at 100x0   box  100x100 green
    at 200x0   box  100x100 blue
    at 0x100   box  100x100 black
    at 100x100 box  100x100 white
    at 200x100 box  100x100 beige 
    at 200x100 text 100 "text on top" 
Note that one could use the "at" keyword to place one style on top
of another.  

---Tab: Lining things up

One way to line up things is with the "tab" keyword.  This will advance
the positioning to the next tab stop.  Where are the tab stops?  They 
are at default locations, and can be set with the "tabs" keyword.
    across
    label "Field 1"
    tab
    FIELD-1: field 200
    return
    label "Need longer label"
    tab
    FIELD-1: field 300

---Tabs: Setting tab stops

In the above example, the "tab" keyword did not line up the fields because
the tab stops were too close together.  You can specify tab stops with
the "tabs" keyword.  If you want just a standard number of pixels between
each tab stop, you specify that number as an integer.  If you want more
specific tab stops, you can provide a block of integers.
Tabs are either horizontal tabs (as you probably would think of them) if
the automatic positioning is set to "across," or vertical tabs if the
automatic positioning is set to "below."
    tabs 100 
    across
    label "Field 1"
    tab
    FIELD-1: field 200
    return
    label "Need longer label"
    tab
    FIELD-1: field 300
Notice that the above example is the same as the prior example except
that the number of pixels between tab stops is large enough so that
the single "tab" keyword goes out to a tab stop that is the same for
both fields.

---Space: Space between styles

There is a default number of pixels between items on a window, which
can be change with the "space" keyword.  The attribute of "space" can
be a pair to adjust horizontal and vertical positioning, or it can
be just an integer in which case it will apply in the direction currently
in use for automatic placement (across or below).
    across
    button "button 1"
    button "button 2"
    return
    button "button 3"
    button "button 4"
    return 
    space 50x50
    button "button 5"
    button "button 6"
    return
    button "button 7"
    button "button 8"
    
---Pad: One-time spacing

You can insert some space between one style and the next (horizonatlly or
vertically) with the "pad" keyword followed by either a pair (for both
directions) or an integer (for whatever direction you are going, across or
below).
    across
    button "button 1"
    pad 100x100
    button "button 2"
    return
    button "button 3"
    button "button 4"

---Indent: Horizontal spacing only

The "indent" keyword adds horizontal space.
    across
    button "button 1"
    indent 100
    button "button 2"
    return 
    button "button 3"
    button "button 4"
    
---Guide: Window margins

The "guide" keyword followed by a pair can be used to set a margin
inside a window, sort of like margins on a page.
    across
    guide 100x100
    button "button 1"
    button "button 2"
    button "button 3"
    return
    button "button 4"
    button "button 5"
    button "button 6"
    return
    below
    button "button 7"
    button "button 8"
    button "button 9"
    return
    button "button 10"
    button "button 11"
    button "button 12"  
This example shows (to some, at least) how it can be easy to get confused
with the various placement options.  If you are trying to make a basic
functional layout, it might be best to take a basic boring approach to 
doing it.  Specify "across," maybe set some tab stops, and then start
laying out a window left-to-right top-to-bottom, and don't do fancy things
unless you must.  Realize that there are no perfect choices, only choices
and trade-offs, and if you want to be fancy you might have to suffer mentally
with some complexity.

---Size: Specifying the window size

When you start specifying things you want on a window, the final window
size will be whatever it takes to hold whatever you specified.
If you want to make sure the final window is a certain size, you can 
specify that.
    size 600x480
    across
    button "button 1"
    button "button 2"
    return
    button "button 3"
    button "button 4"

---Origin: The window starting point

When you start specifying items in a window, they will start
near the top left corner, 20x20 pixels in.  That origin point can
be changed.  Note that this is not the place on the screen where
the window is displayed, but rather the place inside the window
where the styles are displayed. 
    size 600x480
    origin 100x100
    across
    button "button 1"
    button "button 2"
    return
    button "button 3"
    button "button 4"

---Backcolor: Coloring the whole window

VID has a default gray color for windows.  Than can be controlled
with the "backcolor" keyword.

    backcolor tan   
    label "Data field"
    field 200 
    button "button 1"
    
===Styles: The things you put on windows

This chapter explains all the styles of interface objects, "styles"
for short, that you can put in windows.  That means the fields, 
buttons, check-boxes, and such that comprise a GUI.  We are trying to 
make this description as complete and correct as possible so you could
use it as a reference manual for a "target" language for writing programs. 
In other words, if you want to write a program to do something, you could
look at this document and see exactly what VID can do, and how to make it
do it, and decide if you want to use VID.

\note If your investigation of REBOL is starting here...

Remember that this document does not describe REBOL.  It describes that
part of REBOL that is used for making windows.  The target audience of this
document is someone who knows REBOL but needs a clear idea of exactly what
can be accomplished with VID.  The non-GUI part of REBOL is described in
great detail on the REBOL web site.  Attention should be directed to
the documentation mentioned at this start of this document.

/note

This chapter will contain a section for each style of interface object
that can be put on a GUI window.  For each style, we will try to provide:

*All the "facets" that can reasonably apply to that style, referencing 
the previous chapter that explains all the possible facets.  
As noted previously, because all styles come from a master interface 
object, one could potentially apply all facets to any style.
Because the number of combinations would be too vast to list, this
document shows the ones that would be most likely to be used. 
Remember that facets are
keywords and values that follow the sytle word. 

*An explanation of how to use that style.  For example, if the style is a
button, you will want to know how to make the button do something.  If the
style is a field, you will want to know how to get whatever is typed into
the field.  If the style is text on the window, you will want to know how
to refresh it.

*A decent set of examples.  It will not be possible to give examples of
everything.  We want to provide enough examples so you can start using 
the style right away.

Because of the way REBOL is written, all styles of interface objects are
like instances of a master interface object, a "face."  That means that
potentially all of the facets could apply to any style of a face.  In other
words, you could put an image on a button, you can make some action happen
when you enter data in a field; things that might make sense.  As much as
possible, all possible combinations will be noted.

\note An exception to the principle of complete examples

We are not going to try to explain whether or not the "effect" facet
is available for a style, unless it is something really commonly used.
The reason for that is that there are so many combinations of effects.
Take as a given that you probably can apply an effect to any style if
it seems to make sense, and then try it if you like.  There are just
too many combinations to try to document all combinations for all
styles.  The effects seem to be mainly for decoration, and you don't
need decoration to make a functioning program. 

Another facet we will not explain is the "feel" facet.  Because this
facet is used for things like detecting window events, you should
assume that it can be applied to anything on a window.  Then, if you
think you want this facet, put it on the style and use the REBOL
documentation to create the feel, as explained in the documentation
noted above under the "feel" definition.  Once again, this area is
too large to provide documentation for every combination.   

/note

At some point it might be helpful to perform the following exercise.
Make a folder somewhere; doesn't matter where.  Copy the following script
to an editor, save it, and run it:
    REBOL [
        Title: "Extract code for all VID styles"
    ]

    ;; [---------------------------------------------------------------------------]
    ;; [ This is a little utility program for extracting the code behind all the   ]
    ;; [ VID styles and writing the code for each style into a text file named     ]
    ;; [ <style-name>.txt.  These files then can be examined with a text editor.   ]
    ;; [---------------------------------------------------------------------------]

    CODE-FILENAME: none  ;; will generate name based on style word (dot-txt) 

    CODE-DIR: request-dir
    if not CODE-DIR [
        alert "No folder selected for output"
        quit
    ]
    change-dir CODE-DIR
    foreach [STYLE-WORD STYLE-CODE] svv/vid-styles [
        CODE-FILENAME: copy ""
        CODE-FILENAME: to-file rejoin [
            to-string STYLE-WORD
            ".txt"
        ]
        write CODE-FILENAME STYLE-CODE
    ]
    alert rejoin [
        "Code files created in " 
        CODE-DIR
    ]
When you run it, it will ask for a folder.  Select the one you created.
You will get an alert box indicating that the program is done, and
in that folder you will see the source code for all the styles, one
style per file, with the file name being the style name.  It appears 
that a lot of REBOL is written in REBOL.  If you stare at these file
enough, you could start to get a vague idea of how things work.
If you are handy with programming, you might get a clearer idea.  

---Banner

The banner style is generally used for some big text like a window
heading.

Commonly-used facets:

*text: This is the text of the banner.

*font: This controls the text attributes.

*action: This allows a banner to be clickable. 

*color: Alters default color 

*size: Specified the amount of window space used. 

    banner "Default window heading text"
    banner "Non-shadowed text" font [shadow: none size: 36]
    banner "Banner colored by color word" black 
    banner "Text can be clickable" [print "left-clicked"] [print "right-clicked"]
    banner "Banner with surrounding space" 500x100 

---Title

The title style is another option for window text.

Commonly-used facets:

*text: The text of the title

*font: The appearance of the title

*action: Make the title clickable

*color: Alters default color 

*size: Specified the amount of window space used.

    title "Default title text"
    title "Titles can be made small" font [size: 12]
    title "And clickable" [print "left-clicked"] [print "right-clicked"]



---Vh1 through vh4

The video heading styles are for some variations of the kinds of
text available for dressing up a window.

Commonly-used facets:

*text: The text of the heading.

*font: Controls the appearance.

*action: Make a heading clickable.

*color: Alters default color 

*size: Specified the amount of window space used.

    vh1 "Video heading 1 default appearance"
    vh2 "Video heading 1 default appearance"
    vh3 "Video heading 1 default appearance"
    vh4 "Video heading 1 default appearance"
    vh4 "vh4 can be big" font [size: 36 shadow: none]
    vh1 "vh1 can be small" font [size: 12 shadow: none]
    vh2 "All can be clicked" [print "left-clicked"] [print "right-clicked"] 
    vh3 "And of course colored" red 

---H1 through h4

The document heading styles are for some variations of the kinds of
text available for dressing up a window.

Commonly-used facets:

*text: The text of the heading.

*font: Controls the appearance.

*action: Make a heading clickable.

*color: Alters default color 

*size: Specified the amount of window space used.

    h1 "Document heading 1 default appearance"
    h2 "Document heading 1 default appearance"
    h3 "Document heading 1 default appearance"
    h4 "Document heading 1 default appearance"
    h4 "h4 can be big" font [size: 36 shadow: none]
    h1 "h1 can be small" font [size: 12 shadow: none]
    h2 "All can be clicked" [print "left-clicked"] [print "right-clicked"] 
    h3 "And of course colored" red 

---Label, vlab, lbl, lab

These styles are different looks for labels for things, usually fields.
The label and vlab styles are left- and right- justified labels 
for dark backgrounds.  The lbl and lab styles are for left- and right- 
justified labels on light backgrounds. 

Commonly-used facets:

*text: The text of the label.

*font: Controls the appearance.

*action: Make a label clickable.

*color: Alters default color

*size: Specified the amount of window space used. 

    label "Default label style"
    vlab "Default vlab style"
    lbl "Default lbl style"
    lab "Default lab style" 
    label "Longer labels need sizes" 500
    vlab "vlab is right justified" 500 font [size: 16]
    lbl "Actions are allowed" 500 [print "left-clicked"] [print "right-clicked"] 
    lab "lab is right justified also" 500 
    label "label styles can be colored" 500 red 

---Text, body, vtext, txt, code, tt

These styles are used for putting text on the window.
The styles that are not "text" are basically "text" styles with some
pre-defined features for common uses.

The key word "as-is" can be used if a text style is big enough to hold
multiple lines, and you have multiple lines each terminated by a line-feed.
The "as-is" will make those line breaks happen in the text area. 

Commonly-used facets:

*text: The text of the label.

*font: Controls the appearance.

*action: Make a label clickable.

*color: Alters default color

*size: Specified the amount of window space used. 

    text 500 "Default text style"
    body 500 "Default body style"
    vtext 500 "Default vtext style" 
    txt 500 "Default txt style"
    code 500 "Default code style"
    tt 500 "Default tt style"
    text 500x40 "The text styles can be colored" blue
    body 500x40 "Fonts can be controlled" font [size: 24]
    vtext 500x40 "Text can be clickable" [print "left-clicked"] [print "right-clicked"] 
    txt 500x40 "Space on window can be set" 

---Info

This style is used for text in a field-like border that makes it look
like a grayed-out entry field, which it is not.  It is used for displaying
text.

Commonly-used facets:

*text: The text of the label.

*font: Controls the appearance.

*action: Make a label clickable, but only with the left button.

*color: Alters default color of the background, not the text. 

*size: Specified the amount of window space used. 

    info 500 "Informational text in a field-like box."
    info 500 red "Color facet will color the field, not the text."
    info 500x40 "Font size can be controlled" font [size: 24]
    info 500 "info field can have only left-click actions"
         [print "left-clicked"] [print "right-click does not work"]

---Image

This style puts an image on a window.
The source of the image is specified by the image "facet,"
which is a file name or a url that points to an image file.
You may use jpeg, bmp, or gif images.

Commonly-used facets:

*image: The name of an image file

*action: An image can be clickable.

*size: This specifies the size of the area to be filled with the image.

*text:  You may put test on top of the image.

*font: Controls the appearance of the text facet if it is present.

*color:  This will overlay the picture with a color.

*effect:  Apply visual effects, as explained in the section on effect. 

    image 100x100 http://www.rebol.com/graphics/reb-logo.gif red
        "test" font [color: blue]
        [print "left-clicked"] [print "right-clicked"] 

\note

There is a bit of definitial fuzziness here that might cause
confusion.  It might be best not to expect definitional purity,
but to accept what works.  A "text" style is the word "text" 
followed by the text "facet" which is the actual text.
The "font" facet is another facet which can be applied to the
"text" style to specify attributes of the text. So really, the
"font" facet is a facet of another facet, namely, the text facet,
and not a facet of the "text" style.  This shows up more clearly
in the "image" sytle which can have a "text" facet, namely, some
text on top of the image, and that "text" facet can have its own
"font" facet to change, for example, the color.  This might be
confusing if you are looking for a clean and rigorous heirarchy
where styles have facets.  How can an image have a "font" facet
since an image is not text?  This seems to be related to the idea
that all styles are variations of a master "face" or "interface
object," and so any style can have all possible facets in theory,
but not all facets make sense so not all will work.  But a surprising
number will.  So if you are making a window and wonder if you can
put a picture on the window and some red text on top of it, just
try it because it might work

/note

---Box

This style puts a box on a window.
You can use it for a box to put stuff in, or you can use a colored
box like a bar if you make it long and narrow.

Commonly-used facets:

*image: The name of an image file to be put in the box 

*action: An box can be clickable 

*size: This specifies the size of the box. 

*text:  You may put test in the box.

*font: Controls the appearance of the text facet if it is present.

*color:  This will overlay the picture with a color.

*effect:  Apply visual effects, as explained in the section on effect. 

*rate:  Apply a timer event.  

\note 

As noted above, because of the design of
VID, almost all facets can be applied to almost all styles, so the "rate"
facet could be applied to any style besides a box.  However, other styles
have specific main uses, so the box is a good candidate for applying a
timer if you have a need for that kind of operation. 

/note

    return 
    TIMER: box 300x40 black rate 1 feel [engage: [TIMER/text: to-string now show TIMER]] 

---Button

The button style is a clickable button.

Commonly-used facets:

*size: This is a pair that sets the size of the button.

*text: This is a text string that will be printed on the button.

*color: This is a tuple or word to set the button color.

*image: This can be used to put a picture on a button.

*action: This is a block of code after the button.

*character: A button can have a shortcut key.

*font: This controls the font of the text facet.

Size, color, and text examples:
    button "Default look"
    button 200x100 red "Large button, default text"
    button 500x100 blue "Long button, larger text"
        font [size: 20 align: 'left shadow: none colors: [255.0.0 0.255.0]]
        edge [size: 4x4 color: green effect: 'bevel]
    button 200x60 %TestImage.jpg
Note that you will have to provide your own picture
called "TestImage.jpg" to show an image on a button. 
Note also the "colors" attribute, which is not clearly mentioned in the
official documentation.  This attribute controls the color of the text
when the button is displayed, and the color the text changes to when the
mouse moves over the button.  

There is another attribute of the font facet that seems to work on Windows
and might or might not work on other platforms.  If you use the Windows
control panel to get into the "fonts" area, you can see a list of fonts, 
listed by name.  Those names can be used to control the font of the button
text as shown in this example:
    banner "Button font and color test"
    button 300x40 "Default"
    button 300x40 "Times New Roman" font [
        colors: [255.0.0 0.255.0]  
        name: "Times New Roman"
        size: 20
    ]
    button 300x40 "Bauhaus 93 Regular" font [
        colors: [255.0.0 0.255.0]  
        name: "Bauhaus 93 Regular"
        size: 20
    ]
    button 300x40 "Brush Script MT Italic" font [
        colors: [255.0.0 0.255.0]  
        name: "Brush Script MT Italic"
        size: 20
    ]
    button 300x40 "Haettenschweiler Regular" font [
        colors: [255.0.0 0.255.0]  
        name: "Haettenschweiler Regular"
        size: 20
    ]
    button 300x40 "Showcard Gothic Regular" yellow font [
        colors: [0.255.0 0.0.255]  
        name: "Showcard Gothic Regular"
        size: 20
    ]
    button 300x40 "Quit" [quit]

Action examples:
    button "button 1" 
        #"b" 
        [print "Left click"] 
        [print "Right click"]

---Btn, btn-cancel, btn-enter, btn-help

These are buttons with some attributes pre-set, for specific
uses.  That does not mean that they can't have other facets set,
or that they can't have other uses.  It means they are pre-made
buttons for some uses that are so common you are highly likely
to need one of these buttons.

Commonly-used facets:

*size:  You can specify the size, but might not want to bother
since these are somewhat-predefined buttons. 

*text: This is text for the btn style.  The other buttons
have pre-assigned text. 

*action: This is the block of code after the button.

Examples:
    btn "Click" [print "btn left click"] [print "btn right click"]
    btn-cancel  [print "btn-cancel left click"] [print "btn-cancel right click"]
    btn-enter  [print "btn-enter left click"] [print "btn-enter right click"]
    btn-help  [print "btn-help left click"] [print "btn-help right click"]
    btn 100
    btn-cancel 100 
    btn-enter 100 
    btn-help 100 

Remeber again, that because all styles are descendents of a master 
interface object, you can specify other facets for these pre-made
buttons, but why use a pre-made button if you want to make it into
something different? 

---Bar

This is a basic horizontal bar, for window decoration.

Commonly-used facets:

*size: This controls the length.  I also can control thickness,
if you must.

*color: This controls the color of the bar.

Examples:
    bar
    bar 300
    bar 200x30
    bar red

---Icon

This style displays a specified image file as a standard-size
icon with a caption.

Commonly-used-facets:

*image:  This identifies the image file to be turned into an icon.

*size:  This controls the size if you don't want the standard size.

*font:  This controls some attributes of the caption, but it appears
that not all attributes work.

*action:  These are left-click and right-click blocks of code that
are executed when you click the icon. 

Examples (You will have to provide your own image file):
    icon %testimage.jpg "test image" 
        [print "Left click"] [print "Right click"] 
    icon 100x100 %testimage.jpg "test image" 
    icon 150x150 %testimage.jpg "test image" 
        font [color: black size: 20]

Note again.  You can control some facets of the icon, but why
bother.  VID is very handy for quick GUI windows.  If you insist
on tweaking every little attribute of everything, you are negating
some of the benefits of VID.  

---logo-bar

This appears to be the REBOL logo in a vertical bar of a fairly
fixed size.

Commonly-used facets:

None discovered at this time.

Examples:
    logo-bar

---Led

This is a little indicator button.  It has a color of either
red or green that toggles when left-clicked.

Commonly-used facets:

*size:  Size can be specifiedd, if you don't like the default
which seems readonable for an LED.

*action:  This is an action block that will be executed on
left-click.  Right-click does not work.  What happens when you
click the LED is that the procedure is executed and the color
toggles between red and green.  It would be up to your code to
keep track of when things are "on" or "off."

Examples:
    led  [print "Left click small"] 
    led 50x50 [print "Left click big"]

---Arrow

This is a pre-defined graphic of an arrow similar to a "play"
button or a navigation arrow.  The direction of the arrow is
specified by the keyword "up," "down," "left," or "right."

Commonly-used facets:

*action:  Only the left-click action works, and it specifies
what to do when the arrow is clicked.

Examples:
    arrow 
    arrow 50x50
    arrow 50x50 left
    arrow 50x50 down
    arrow 50x50 right
    arrow 60x60 red [print "Left click"] [print "Right click"] 

---Progress

This is a progress bar like you are used to seeing on many applications.

Commonly-used facets:

*size:  There is a default size, but any size can be specified.

*color:  You can specify a background color for the bar plus a color
for the moving part of the bar.

*data:  This facet is set to a fractional number between zero and one,
which indicates what fraction of the bar is filled.

The way this is used is that you set the "data" facet to a number from
zero to one, and then refresh the progress bar with the "show" function.

Example (This is a complete program, so don't put this inside the
"view layout."  Put underneath a REBOL header.)

    DELAY-COUNTER: 0
    DELAY-LIMIT: 3        ;; 6.5 SECONDS
    CHECK-DELAY: does [
        DELAY-COUNTER: DELAY-COUNTER + 1
        if DELAY-COUNTER > DELAY-LIMIT [
            DELAY-COUNTER: 0
        ]
    ]

    PROGRESS-COUNT: 0
    PROGRESS-END: 100000
    PROGRESS-MSG: ""
    PROGRESS-RUN: does [
        repeat n PROGRESS-END [
            PROGRESS-COUNT: PROGRESS-COUNT + 1
            CHECK-DELAY
            if (DELAY-COUNTER = 0) [
                PROGRESS-MSG: copy ""
                PROGRESS-MSG: rejoin [
                    "Counting at "
                    to-string PROGRESS-COUNT
                    " of "
                    to-string PROGRESS-END
                ]
                set-face PROGRESS-TEXT PROGRESS-MSG
                PROGRESS-BAR/data: n / PROGRESS-END
                show PROGRESS-BAR
            ]
        ]
    ]

    view layout [
        PROGRESS-BAR: progress 620x40 white red
        PROGRESS-TEXT: h1 400
        button "Go" [PROGRESS-RUN]
    ] 

---Field

\note

There is, on the REBOL web site, a very thorough article on how to
use fields.  It is much more detailed than what you see below. 

/note 

This is the commonly-used sytle for entering short data items.

Commonly-used facets: 

*size:  You might want to make bigger fields to hold bigger text.

*color:  This controls the background color.  A second color facet 
indicates the color to show when the field is being filled, or when
it "has the focus" as they say in the lingo.

*text:  This refers to the text that has been entered into the field,
and also to any text you might specify in the layout that "pre-fills"
the field. 

font:  This controls the size of the text that is displayed as it is
typed into the field.

edge:  This allows for borders around the field. 

There also are shortcut alignment words, as shown in the example.

Other facets can be used, but don't necessarily make sense.  The "action"
facet will cause some action to be performed when the "enter" key is
pressed or when you move out of the field after entering text into it.
You can put an image in the field background.  If you want more than
a basic field for data entry, do read the article about fields on the
REBOL web site.  You will note, at the end of the document, promises of
more documentation to come, that never seemed to arrive. 
If you are not a designer, you can do more with fields than you can
imagine.  

Examples:
    field 200 beige red
    field 300x40 font [size: 16 style: 'bold]
    field "left" left
    field "center" center
    field "rignt" right
    field 200x40 "top" top
    field 200x40 "middle" middle
    field 200x40 "bottom" bottom

The obvious question that comes up is, how does one get one's hands
on the data from a field.  This is done be accessing the "text" facet.
One assigns a name to a field, and then refers to field-name(slash)text,
as shown in the examples below.  It seems that in later versions of
REBOL, a special function came into being called "get-face," with a
matching one called "set-face" for changing the text facet.
Note in the examples the use of the "copy" function.  This seems to
be related to the fact the words in REBOL are not "variables" in the
same way they are in other languages.  A word "refers" to a value, 
but does not "contain" it.  

Examples: 
    across
    label "FIELD-1"
    FIELD-1: field 200 "Initial value"
    return
    label "FIELD-1-VALUE"
    FIELD-1-VALUE: text 200
    return
    label "FIELD-2"
    FIELD-2: field 200
    return
    button 200 "Show FIELD-1" [
        FIELD-1-VALUE/text: copy FIELD-1/text
        show FIELD-1-VALUE
    ]
    return
    button 200 "FIELD-1 := FIELD-2" [
        FIELD-1/text: copy FIELD-2/text
        show FIELD-1
    ]
    return
    label "FIELD-3"
    FIELD-3: field 200 "Initial value"
    return
    label "FIELD-3-VALUE"
    FIELD-3-VALUE: text 200
    return
    label "FIELD-4" 
    FIELD-4: field 200
    return
    button 200 "Show FIELD-3" [
        set-face FIELD-3-VALUE copy get-face FIELD-3
    ]
    return
    button 200 "FIELD-3 := FIELD-4" [
        set-face FIELD-3 copy get-face FIELD-4
    ]

---Area

\note

As noted under "field," there is a more thorough document on the 
REBOL web site about text styles.

/note

This is a style used for entry of larger amounts of text, like
paragraphs of it.

Commonly-used facets:

*size:  There is a default area size, but you may specify your
own with a pair representing width by height.

*color:  One or two color words set the background and text colors.

*text:  This is the text in the area.

*font:  A font block can be used to specify the various font attributes.

There are two other words used to control text.  The key word "wrap"
indicates that text will be wrapped inside the area so lines of text
don't run out of the area on the right side.  The key word "as-is," 
which is the default state, indicates that the text will not wrap. 

Examples (Put this under a REBOL header): 
    TEST-TEXT-1: {
    The obvious question that comes up is, how does one get one's hands
    on the data from a field.  This is done be accessing the "text" facet.
    One assigns a name to a field, and then refers to field-name(slash)text,
    as shown in the examples below.  It seems that in later versions of
    REBOL, a special function came into being called "get-face," with a
    matching one called "set-face" for changing the text facet.
    Note in the examples the use of the "copy" function.  This seems to
    be related to the fact the words in REBOL are not "variables" in the
    same way they are in other languages.  A word "refers" to a value, 
    but does not "contain" it.  
    }
    view layout [
        label "Default area size"
        AREA-1: area "Default area size"
        label "Another size with default text, not wrapped"
        AREA-2: area 300x200 as-is green black TEST-TEXT-1
        label "Area with wrapped text"
        AREA-3: area 300x200 wrap TEST-TEXT-1 font [size: 16]
    ] 

To get and change the contents of an area, refer to the "text"
facet.  As with the "field," note the use of the "copy" function.
Note also that when setting a value in a large text area, one
must set an item called "line-list" as shown in the example below.
    TEST-TEXT-1: {

    but does not "contain" it.  
    }
    TEST-TEXT-2: {
    Other facets can be used, but don't necessarily make sense.  The "action"
    facet will cause some action to be performed when the "enter" key is
    pressed or when you move out of the field after entering text into it.
    You can put an image in the field background.  If you want more than
    a basic field for data entry, do read the article about fields on the

            show CONTENTS 
        ]
    ] 

---Text-list

This is a style used for picking things from a list.
The list is a block of single text items.  

Commonly-used facets:

*size:  There is a default size, and you can alter the size.

*color:  One or two color words set the text and background colors.

*data:  This is a block of items that are put into the list.

*font:  This controls the font of the data items.

Examples:
    label "Default text-list size"
    text-list
    label "Other text-list attributes"
    text-list 400x100 green black 
        font [size: 16 name: font-fixed]
        data [
        "Item 01-01"
        "Item 01-02"
        "Item 01-03"
        "Item 01-04"
        "Item 01-05"
        "Item 01-06"
        "Item 01-07"
        "Item 01-08"
        "Item 01-09"
        "Item 01-10"
        "Item 01-11"
        "Item 01-12"
        "Item 01-13"
        "Item 01-14"
        "Item 01-15"
        "Item 01-16"
        "Item 01-17"
        "Item 01-18"
        "Item 01-19"

To load a list, set the "data" refinement and re-show the list.
To get the item that is selected from the list, use the "picked"
refinement:
    LIST-1-DATA: [
        "Item 01-01"
        "Item 01-02"
        "Item 01-03"
        "Item 01-04"
        "Item 01-05"
        "Item 01-06"

        "Item 01-09"
        "Item 01-10"

If you are adding to the list as the program runs, then it seems that if 
you put more data into the list than was there initially, you have to
make an adjustment to the built-in scroller.  In the following example,
Click the "Load list 2" button first, and you will see that the scroller
is inoperative.  Then click the "Load list 3" button which loads a larger
block of data and also has a line of code to adjust the scroller.
You should see that the scroller now works.  If you go back to loading
either "list 1" or "list 2," you will see that the scroller remains 
operative.

---List

The list style is a general style for multi-column lists of data.
Because it is more general than a text-list, it is more complicated.
There is a very thorough lesson on using lists at this link:

<a href="http://business-programming.com/business_programming.html#section-17.21">
Creating Multi-Column GUI Text Lists (Data Grids) From Scratch</a>

To create a list, you use the "list" keyword followed by three things.

The first thing is a size pair, since there is no default size.

The second thing is a block that is a mini-layout defining the items in
a row of the list.  It uses regular layout keywords.  Usually there is
the keyword "across" to cause the list columns to run across the window,
because that is the kind of thing we are trying to create with a list.
Other facets can be specified, like fonts, and also action facets to
cause things to happen when list items are clicked.  

The third thing is a block of blocks, identified by the keyword "data".  
Each block in that data block contains
items that match the columns defined in the layout block.  
This example shows this basic setup:
    LIST-DATA: [
        ["Item 01-01" "Item 02-01"]
        ["Item 01-02" "Item 02-02"]
        ["Item 01-03" "Item 02-03"]
        ["Item 01-04" "Item 02-04"]
        ["Item 01-05" "Item 02-05"]
        ["Item 01-06" "Item 02-06"]
        ["Item 01-07" "Item 02-07"]
        ["Item 01-08" "Item 02-08"]
        ["Item 01-09" "Item 02-09"]
        ["Item 01-10" "Item 02-10"]
        ["Item 01-11" "Item 02-11"]
        ["Item 01-12" "Item 02-12"]
        ["Item 01-13" "Item 02-13"]
        ["Item 01-14" "Item 02-14"]
        ["Item 01-15" "Item 02-15"]
        ["Item 01-16" "Item 02-16"]
        ["Item 01-17" "Item 02-17"]
        ["Item 01-18" "Item 02-18"]
        ["Item 01-19" "Item 02-19"]
        ["Item 01-20" "Item 02-20"]
    ]
    view layout [
        label "No default list size"
        across
        DEMO-LIST: list 200x200 [
               across
               text 100 [print ["clicked " value]]
               text 100 [print ["clicked " value]]
            ]
            data LIST-DATA
    ]

As seen in the above example, the data block has more data than will
fit in the list window, and no scroll bar is provided.  To fix that,
you have to manage it yourself.  Here is how.

In the layout, replace the "data" block with a function, called "supply."
This function will be executed when you "show" the list, and it will be
executed for each "cell" so to speak, that is, for row 1 column 1, then
row 1 column 2, then row 2 column 1, row 2 column2, and so on.
Two variables will be available during that process.  The variable 
"count" refers to the row being filled, and the variable "index"
refers to the column being filled.  You use "count" and "index" 
along with the "pick" function to pull data items out of a block of
blocks, and use the keyword "face" to refer to the current item of
the list being filled.  This is shown in the example coming up.

Because you are using the "supply" function to load the list,
you can make use of that by using a scroller to adjust the starting
point in the block of data.  The scroller's value, identified by the
keyword "value," contains a number from zero to one.  Multiplying the
total length of the data block by the scroller's value (which is a
fraction between zero and one) will give a starting point for pulling
data out of the data block.  You can add that starting point to the
"count" variable in the "supply" function.

As a final thing to remember, as shown in the example below, what
happens you hit the end of the data block before the list is filled?
This is handled by checking for "none" when picking a row of data.
If you get "none," set that data item you are trying to fill to "none"
and exit the supply function.

This example tries to show all of the above:
    STARTING-DATA-ROW: 0 
    LIST-DATA: [
        ["Item 01-01" "Item 02-01"]
        ["Item 01-02" "Item 02-02"]
        ["Item 01-03" "Item 02-03"]
        ["Item 01-04" "Item 02-04"]
        ["Item 01-05" "Item 02-05"]
        ["Item 01-06" "Item 02-06"]
        ["Item 01-07" "Item 02-07"]
        ["Item 01-08" "Item 02-08"]
        ["Item 01-09" "Item 02-09"]
        ["Item 01-10" "Item 02-10"]
        ["Item 01-11" "Item 02-11"]
        ["Item 01-12" "Item 02-12"]
        ["Item 01-13" "Item 02-13"]
        ["Item 01-14" "Item 02-14"]
        ["Item 01-15" "Item 02-15"]
        ["Item 01-16" "Item 02-16"]
        ["Item 01-17" "Item 02-17"]
        ["Item 01-18" "Item 02-18"]
        ["Item 01-19" "Item 02-19"]
        ["Item 01-20" "Item 02-20"]
    ]
    view layout [
        label "No default list size"
        across
        DEMO-LIST: list 200x200 [
               across
               text 100 [print ["clicked " value]]
               text 100 [print ["clicked " value]]
            ]
            supply [
                count: count + STARTING-DATA-ROW 
                ;; Pick the row to load, if none, set cell to "none" and exit
                if none? PICKED-ROW: pick LIST-DATA count [face/text: none exit]
                ;; Use index to pick data out of current row, then set cell value
                face/text: pick PICKED-ROW index  ;; "face" refers to current cell
            ]
        slider 20X200 [    ;; Code executed when slider is moved
            STARTING-DATA-ROW: (length? LIST-DATA) * value
            show DEMO-LIST
        ]
    ]

Because the "list" style is analyzed so thoroughly in the above link,
no more documentation is presented here.  Because of the layout block
that is part of the "list" definition, and the fact that is is VID layout
code, you can have lists of other things besides text.  You could have
a list of buttons, for example, and the buttons could have actions. 
Because of the "supply" function that loads the list, you can take various
actions depending on the values of "count" and "index."  A common example
is to vary the color of the cell being loaded, so that maybe for the even
rows you use one color and the odd rows another.  Many ideas are presented
in the above linked document.

---Drop-down

This is the regular drop-down list. The data comes from a block which
may be coded in-line for small lists or may be elsewhere for longer ones.

Commonly-used facets:  

size:  The horizontal size can be set, but trying to use a pair does
not give expected results.

rows:  This seems to be how to set the number of items if you want
more than the default of 4.

color:  One or two colors may be specified for text and background.

data:  This is a block used to populate the list.

font:  This controls the appearance of the chosen item, but not the
items in the list when you drop it down.

action:  You may take action as soon as an item is chosen, or you
may not, and just refer to the choice later.

text:  This is the facet used when you want to refer to the item
that was chosen from the list.

It seems that the vertical size of the drop-down list can be controlled
with the "rows" facet, but it will not go down beyond the bottom of
the window.  So, in the example below, there is a box below the
drop-down, just so that the resulting window has enough vertical size
to allow the list to drop down far enough to show the choices.

Example (Use under a REBOL header.):
    DROP-DOWN-CHOICES: [
        "Choice 01"
        "Choice 02"
        "Choice 03"
        "Choice 04"
        "Choice 05"
        "Choice 06"
        "Choice 07"
        "Choice 08"
        "Choice 09"
        "Choice 10"
        "Choice 11"
        "Choice 12"
        "Choice 13"
        "Choice 14"
        "Choice 15"
        "Choice 16"
        "Choice 17"
        "Choice 18"
        "Choice 19"
        "Choice 20"
    ]
    view layout [
        CHOICE-LIST: drop-down 200 green black data DROP-DOWN-CHOICES  
            [set-face SELECTED-CHOICE CHOICE-LIST/text]     
            font [style: 'bold size: 14] rows 10
        box 200x200 yellow 
        SELECTED-CHOICE: text 200 
    ] 

The above example shows how a drop-down is populated when a layout is
created.  It is possible to change the contents at run time.  It seems
that the drop-down style has a function (reset) to clear its contents, 
and it seems that the contents are referred to by the word "list-data."
Modifying a drop-down could be done like the following example.
This is a complete script.  Note the two lines in the LOAD-SUBCAT function
that reset the drop-down and load the list-data. Note also the "set-face"
line that sets the visible part of the drop-down to the first line of
the list of selections.  

    REBOL []
    
    CATEGORIES: [
        "ActiveDirectory" ["ResetPassword" "UnlockAccount"]
        "Laptop" ["LoginFailure" "XXX" "yyy"]
        "Phones" ["NewCord" "xxx" "yyy"]
    ]
    SUBCATS: []
    
    LOAD-SUBCAT: does [
        SUBCATS: copy [] 
        SUBCATS: copy select CATEGORIES get-face MAIN-CATEGORY
        MAIN-SUBCAT/reset
        MAIN-SUBCAT/list-data: SUBCATS
        set-face MAIN-SUBCAT SUBCATS/1
    ]
    
    MAIN-WINDOW: layout [
        MAIN-CATEGORY: drop-down 150 data (extract CATEGORIES 2) [LOAD-SUBCAT]
        MAIN-SUBCAT: drop-down 150 
        button "Quit" [quit]
        box 150x100 ;; So drop-down will show 
    ]
    
    view center-face MAIN-WINDOW 

---Rotary

This is an item similar to the drop-down, except that it is a button,
and every click of the button rotates through a list of choices. 

Commonly-used facets:

size:  The size can be set similarly to setting a button size. 

color:  One or two colors may be specified for text and background.

data:  This is a block used to populate the list.

font:  This controls the appearance of text on the button. 

action:  You may take action as soon as an item is chosen, or you
may not, and just refer to the choice later.

text:  This is the facet used when you want to refer to the item
that was chosen from the list.

Example (Put this under a REBOL header.):
    ROTARY-CHOICES: [
        "Choice 01"
        "Choice 02"
        "Choice 03"
        "Choice 04"
        "Choice 05"
        "Choice 06"
        "Choice 07"
        "Choice 08"
        "Choice 09"
        "Choice 10"
        "Choice 11"
        "Choice 12"
        "Choice 13"
        "Choice 14"
        "Choice 15"
        "Choice 16"
        "Choice 17"
        "Choice 18"
        "Choice 19"
        "Choice 20"
    ]
    view layout [
        CHOICE-LIST: rotary 200x50 green black data ROTARY-CHOICES  
            [set-face SELECTED-CHOICE CHOICE-LIST/text]     
            font [style: 'bold size: 14] 
        SELECTED-CHOICE: text 200 
    ]

---Choice

This is another way to get a data item from a window.
A "choice" style looks like a button, and when you click the
button all the specified choices appear below it for selection.

Commonly-used facets:

size:  The size can be set similarly to setting a button size.
If you specify a vertical size, all the choices that appear will
have that size, but the list will not extend below the bottom of
the window.  

color:  It appears that only one color can be specified, and that
is for the background color of the choice button. 

data:  This is a block used to populate the list.

font:  This controls the appearance of text on the button. 

action:  You may take action as soon as an item is chosen, or you
may not, and just refer to the choice later.

text:  This is the facet used when you want to refer to the item
that was chosen from the list.

Example (Put this under a REBOL header.): 
    CHOICE-CHOICES: [
        "Choice 01"
        "Choice 02"
        "Choice 03"
        "Choice 04"
        "Choice 05"
        "Choice 06"
        "Choice 07"
        "Choice 08"
        "Choice 09"
        "Choice 10"
        "Choice 11"
        "Choice 12"
        "Choice 13"
        "Choice 14"
        "Choice 15"
        "Choice 16"
        "Choice 17"
        "Choice 18"
        "Choice 19"
        "Choice 20"
    ]
    view layout [
        CHOICE-LIST: choice 200 green data CHOICE-CHOICES  
            [set-face SELECTED-CHOICE CHOICE-LIST/text]     
            font [style: 'bold size: 14]
        box 200x500 beige 
        SELECTED-CHOICE: text 200 
    ]

---Toggle, tog

This is a way of obtaining "either/or" kind of input.
A toggle looks like a button, and you specify two values.
When you click the toggle, the text facet changes to the
value on the toggle button, and then the visible value on
the button changes to the other specified value.

It appears that the "tog" style is a toggle with some
appearance attributes set, probably ones that are more
commonly used. 

Commonly-used facets:

size:  The size can be set similarly to setting a button size.

color:  It is appropriate to specifiy two color values, because
the toggle, by nature of its two-valued state, needs two colors
to differentiate the states. 

font: This is used to specify attributes of the text on the button.
It appears that not all values work. 

action:  You may take action as soon as an item is chosen, or you
may not, and just refer to the choice later.
Both left-button and right-button actions may be specified.

text:  This is the facet used when you want to refer to the item
that was chosen from the list.  It is the text printed on the
button.

Example:
    TOGGLESWITCH: toggle 200x50 red green "ON" "OFF" 
        font [size: 20 color: black]
        [set-face SELECTED-CHOICE TOGGLESWITCH/text]   
        [set-face RIGHT-CLICK-CHOICE TOGGLESWITCH/text]   
    SELECTED-CHOICE: text 200
    RIGHT-CLICK-CHOICE: text 200   
    tog "ON" "OFF"

---Check, check-mark, check-line

These are check boxes for yes/no kind of data.
The "check" style is a box that can be modified a bit with size and
color.  The "check-mark" and "check-line" appear to be "check"
styles with some attributes pre-set.

Commonly-used facets:

color:  For a "check" you can specify different colors for
"checked" and "un-checked."  Colors do little or nothing for the
other styles.  

data: This is a true or false value that is set when the item is
checked or un-checked.

Examples:
    across
    CHECK-1: check 40x40 tan yellow [print CHECK-1/data]
    return
    CHECK-2: check-mark [print CHECK-2/data] 
    return 
    CHECK-3: check-line [print CHECK-3/data] 

---Radio, radio-line

The radio button is something for mutually-exclusive choices.
The radio-line style seems to be the same as a radio button.

Commonly-used facets:

data:  This is a true or false value depending on whether or
not the button is checked.  It seems that there is a difference
between un-checked and never checked.  A button that never has 
been checked has a value of none.

Examples (Put this under a REBOL header):
    SHOW-ALL-VALUES: does [
        print ["RADIO-1: " RADIO-1/data]
        print ["RADIO-2: " RADIO-2/data]
        print ["RADIO-3: " RADIO-3/data]
        print ["RADIO-4: " RADIO-4/data]
        print "----------------"
    ]
    view layout [
        RADIO-1: radio
        RADIO-2: radio
        bar
        RADIO-3: radio 
        RADIO-4: radio
        bar
        button "Show all values" [SHOW-ALL-VALUES]
    ]

In the above example, the buttons are mututally exclusive for
the whole window.  Often, one wants more than one group of buttons.
This can be done by using a word to group buttons, as shown in
this example:

    SHOW-ALL-VALUES: does [
        print ["RADIO-1: " RADIO-1/data]
        print ["RADIO-2: " RADIO-2/data]
        print ["RADIO-3: " RADIO-3/data]
        print ["RADIO-4: " RADIO-4/data]
        print "----------------"
    ]
    view layout [
        RADIO-1: radio of 'GROUP-1
        RADIO-2: radio of 'GROUP-1
        bar
        RADIO-3: radio of 'GROUP-2
        RADIO-4: radio of 'GROUP-2 
        bar
        button "Show all values" [SHOW-ALL-VALUES]
    ]

---Scroller, slider

The scroller and slider are two variations of the same thing,
that bar with the thing you grab and drag to scroll through
some thing that is too big to show entirely in whatever you
are trying to show it in.  Usually, that means a block of text
that is long, so that you have to scroll down to see it all.
The scroller and slider differ in the presence of the arrows
at the ends.

Commonly-used facets:

size:  Normally one would set the lengh of the scroller/slider
to match the length of what is being scrolled, and set the
width to something that is grabbable with a mouse pointer, like
around 16 pixels.

data: This is a numeric value that varies from zero to one as 
the slider is operated.

action:  An action block is executed every time the slider moves
so much as a pixel.  

Examples (Put this under a REBOL header): 
    SHOW-SCROLLER-3-VAL: does [
        set-face SCROLLER-3-VAL to-string SCROLLER-3/data
    ]
    SHOW-SLIDER-4-VAL: does [
        set-face SLIDER-4-VAL to-string SLIDER-4/data
    ]
    view layout [
        across
        SCROLLER-1: scroller [set-face SCROLLER-1-VAL to-string value]
        tab
        SLIDER-1: slider [set-face SLIDER-1-VAL to-string value]
        tab
        SCROLLER-3: scroller [SHOW-SCROLLER-3-VAL]
        tab
        SLIDER-4: slider [SHOW-SLIDER-4-VAL]
        return
        SCROLLER-1-VAL: text 40
        tab
        SLIDER-1-VAL: text 40
        tab
        SCROLLER-3-VAL: text 40
        tab
        SLIDER-4-VAL: text 40
    ]
Another question that will come up is, can one do horizontal scrolling?
If the scroller is wider than it is high, it appears that VID can make
the proper adjustment.  
    across
    SCROLLER-1: scroller 200x16 [set-face SCROLLER-1-VAL to-string value]
    SCROLLER-1-VAL: text 40
    return
    SLIDER-1: slider 200x16 [set-face SLIDER-1-VAL to-string value]
    SLIDER-1-VAL: text 40

The next obvious question is, what does one actually DO with a
slider or scroller?  The answer is, it depends.
In general, there is some item on a window that one wants to scroll
through, and there is an action block on the slider.  The action
block is executed every time the scroller moves, and the value of
the scroller, from zero to one, is available in the "data" facet.
The program has to use that value to find out where the scrollable
item is to be positioned, at the beginning (a data value of zero),
at the end (a data value of one), or somewhere in the middle.
Then the program has to calculate what part of the scrollable item
should be showing, set the visible part of the data to the correct
value, and re-show the scrollable item using the "show" function.
Exactly how that is done varies with the kind of data item being
scrolled.  Examples later in this document will show some ideas.

Here is a very basic example to show the idea.  Since a progress
bar uses a value from zero to one to show progress, and a slider
or scroller gets a value from zero to one as it is moved, we can
make a simple demo to get the value from a slider and use it to
set the value of a progress bar.
    PROGRESS-BAR: progress 400x40
    PROGRESS-SLIDER: slider 400x40
        [PROGRESS-BAR/data: PROGRESS-SLIDER/data show PROGRESS-BAR]

---Sensor

The sensor is an invisible thing on the window. 
Because it is invisible it is hard to click on it.  
The sensor is another good candidate for the "rate" facet for
taking action at time intervals.
    box 100x100 red
    sensor 0x0 rate 00:00:05 feel [
        engage: [
            alert "Time is up"
            quit
        ]
    ]

---Anim

The anim is a way to make something like an animated GIF. 
It uses a block of image file names to rotate through those images
on the screen at a specifiec rate.

Commonly-used facets:

rate: This seems to be slightly different than the regulare "rate."
It appears to be an integer that represents the number of times per
second that the image will change.  This can be shown by specifying a
rate of 1 and watching the image change about once a second.
Specifying a larger number makes it change faster.

frames: This appears to be a special facet related to the anim style.
It is a block of file names of image files.  The indicated images will 
be shown in the style, change as specified in the rate.

Examples:
    anim rate 1 frames [
        %GreenCheck.png
        %RedX.png
    ]

In the above example, the images specified in "frames" are basiclly some
image file just "lying around" when this example was created.  To run the
example for yourself, you will have to find your own images.
The number is not limited to just two as shown in the example.  You can
use more. An upper limit is not known at this time.
The "rate" of 1 will change the image every second. A higher number will
change it faster. 

===Functions:  Doing things with the styles 

The previous chapter listed all the things that one can put on a
window, but that is not the full story of a graphical interface. 
Besides the "layout" function which transforms VID dialect code
into a displayable window, and the "view" function which displays
a window created by "layout," there are other functions used for
making a GUI work.  This section explains those functions.

\note
 
This document should not be your only source of VID knowledge.
Refer to the REBOL function dictionary where there is a section
of REBOL/View functions, and refer to the VID manual mentioned at 
the beginning of this document.  The reason for that is that the
official documentation is not totally complete or clear, and 
the goal of this manual is to make something that IS complete
and clear, which is an impossible goal.  So to make it clear if
not complete, things that are not understood are not mentioned.

/note

In the examples to follow, paste them under a REBOL header and
not inside the "view layout" structure as you did for the
style samples.  The stuff inside a layout block is VID code and
not REBOL code, but the functions to follow are REBOL functions
and NOT VID code, so they do not belong inside a layout block.

---Center-face

This function is mentioned at the beginning because it is used
to center a displayed window in the middle of the screen.  
Some examples below work better if centered.  
No example is provided here.  Look for this function to be used
in the examples for the following function.  When you see it,
know that it is there to cause the window to appear in the middle
of the screen.

---Layout 

This function takes a block of VID code and returns an interface
object that can be viewed with the "view" function.  
The result of the "layout" function can be piped right into the
"view" function or it can be set as a value of a word, and then
the word can be viewed.  

Here is a basic example:
    MAIN-WINDOW: layout [
        button red
        button red
    ]
    view MAIN-WINDOW 

If you don't like the default position of up in the corner, you can
center it with the center-face function as explained above.

Notice that there is a default amount of space around the edges of
the window.  Sometimes you might not want this.  It can be eliminated
with the "tight" refinement:
    MAIN-WINDOW: layout/tight [
        button red
        button red
    ]
    view center-face MAIN-WINDOW 

Notice that "tight" refers just to the space around the edges.
If you want things right up next to each other, you can control
the spacing with the "space" keyword:
    MAIN-WINDOW: layout/tight [
        space 0x0
        button red
        button green
        return
        button yellow
        button blue
    ]
    view center-face MAIN-WINDOW 

---Stylize

The "stylize" function allows you to make a style sheet, which is
a set of styles with pre-defined facets so you don't have to code 
things over and over again.  The function takes a block of styles,
similar to the "layout" function, but the styles are given labels.
Then, in a the "layout" function, you can place those custom styles.
Here is a basic example.  Note that the style sheet is defined with
the "stylize" function, and then invoked in a layout with the "styles"
keyword. 
    LOCAL-STYLES: stylize [
        WINDOW-HEADER: banner yellow font [shadow: none size: 30]
        GO-BUTTON: button 40x40 green
        STOP-BUTTON: button 40x40 red
    ]
    MAIN-WINDOW: layout [
        styles LOCAL-STYLES 
        WINDOW-HEADER "Custom style window"
        GO-BUTTON
        STOP-BUTTON
    ]
    view center-face MAIN-WINDOW

---View

The "view" function has been shown, because it was necessary to show 
anything else.  There are a few options.

In this example, the border and title bar are eliminated, and the outer
border can be resized.  If you use these options, you better provide
your own "close" button because there won't be one on the window.
    MAIN-WINDOW: layout/tight [
        space 0x0
        button red
        button green
        return
        button yellow
        button blue
        return
        button "quit" [quit]
    ]
    view/options center-face MAIN-WINDOW [no-title no-border resize] 

If you do use the title bar, the text can be specified:
    MAIN-WINDOW: layout [
        button red
        button green
        return
        button yellow
        button blue
        return
        button "quit" [quit]
    ]
    view/title center-face MAIN-WINDOW "Custom title window"

If you want to specify where the window should be placed on the screen,
you can use the "offset" refinement of the "layout" function:
    view layout/offset [
        size 600x480
        across
        button "button 1"
        button "button 2"
        return
        button "button 3"
        button "button 4"
    ] 300x300 


---Unview

The "unview" function closes a previously-viewed window.
This would be used perhaps with the "/new" refinement of the "view" function
which would open a new window, which would be closed later by "unviewing" it.
"Unview" by itself will close the most-recently-opened window.
"Unview/all" will unview all windows.
"Unview/only? with a window name will unview a specified window.
For example (Put this under a REBOL header since it has several layouts.):
    GREEN-WINDOW: layout [
        box 200x200 green
        button "Unview me" [unview/only GREEN-WINDOW]
    ]
    RED-WINDOW: layout [
        box 200x200 red
        button "Unview me" [unview/only RED-WINDOW]
    ]
    MAIN-WINDOW: layout [
        button 200 green "View green window" [view/new GREEN-WINDOW]
        button 200 green "Unview green window" [unview/only GREEN-WINDOW]
        button 200 red "View red window" [view/new RED-WINDOW]
        button 200 red "Unview red window" [unview/only RED-WINDOW]  
        button 200 "Unview whatever" [unview]  
        button 200 "Unview all" [unview/all]  
        button 200 "Quit" [quit]    
    ]
    view center-face MAIN-WINDOW

---Viewed?

This is a function for testing if a windows is in view.
You might use this if you had some complicated program with many windows
and interactions that moved from window to window.
    GREEN-WINDOW: layout [
        box 200x200 green
        button "Unview me" [unview/only GREEN-WINDOW]
    ]
    RED-WINDOW: layout [
        box 200x200 red
        button "Unview me" [unview/only RED-WINDOW]
    ]
    MAIN-WINDOW: layout [
        button 200 green "View green window" [view/new GREEN-WINDOW]
        button 200 green "Unview green window" [unview/only GREEN-WINDOW]
        button 200 green "Green window status" [print viewed? GREEN-WINDOW]
        button 200 red "View red window" [view/new RED-WINDOW]
        button 200 red "Unview red window" [unview/only RED-WINDOW]  
        button 200 red "Red window status" [print viewed? RED-WINDOW] 
        button 200 "Unview whatever" [unview]  
        button 200 "Unview all" [unview/all]  
        button 200 "Quit" [quit]    
    ]
    view center-face MAIN-WINDOW

---Show

The "show" function is what you use to change things on a window.
You can "show" a whole layout, or you can "show" individual items 
on a layout.  To reference a layout or a style that you want to show,
you have to assign the item to a word, that is, give a name to the 
layout or style.  
    TEXT-DISPLAY: text 500
    TEXT-FIELD: field 500
    button 500 "Change text to field value" [
        TEXT-DISPLAY/text: copy get-face TEXT-FIELD
        show TEXT-DISPLAY
    ]

If you have update a bunch of styles and want to show them all,
you don't have to code one "show" function for each; you may put 
the style names in a block and "show" the block.

---Hide

The "hide" function is used to make a style invisible.  The style
is not permanently removed; it can be shown again.
As with "show," you may hide a single style, or specify a block
of style names and hide them all with one call to the hide function.
    TEST-BOX: box 200x200 red [print "Box still is here"] 
    button "Show box" [show TEST-BOX]
    button "Hide box" [hide TEST-BOX]
    button "Show window" [show MAIN-WINDOW] 

---Get-face, set-face

It seems that later versions of REBOL/View added special functions 
for accessing the certain values of certain styles.  It appears that
these apply mainly to sytles that hold text.  Earlier documentation
indicates that the text facet of a style is accessed with
(style-name)/text. To set the text facet, one sets (style-name)/text 
and "shows" the style.  Now, with the "set-face" function, the
setting of the value and the showing of the style are one operation.
The "set-face" function as a "no-show" refinement to suppress the
re-showing.  With get-face, note that one must use the "copy" function
or one obtains a reference to the sytle instead of the value of it.
    TEST-FIELD-VALUE: none
    MAIN-WINDOW: layout [
        ENTRY-FIELD: field 400
        ENTRY-VALUE: info 400
        button "Test" [
            TEST-FIELD-VALUE: copy get-face ENTRY-FIELD
            set-face ENTRY-VALUE TEST-FIELD-VALUE
        ]
    ]
    view center-face MAIN-WINDOW   

---Alert

This function is used for popping up a message that the operator
must respond to.  The official documentation says that the only choice
for responding to an alert message is "OK," but a little trial an error
indicates that you can add a second button to the alert message that
will return a "false" result as shown in the example:
    ALERT-MSG-1: "An alert message"
    ALERT-MSG-2: "can be constructed"
    alert "Basic alert message"
    alert rejoin [
        ALERT-MSG-1
        " "
        ALERT-MSG-2
    ]
    ALERT-RESULT: alert "Alert function returns what?"
    print ALERT-RESULT
    GO?: alert [
        "OK to continue?"
        "OK"
        "Cancel"
    ]
    if not GO? [
        alert "Operation canceled"
        print GO?
        halt
    ]
    print GO? 
    halt

---Request-file

This is function to pop up the appropriate file requestor window
for the host operating system.  The REBOL documentation shows a 
number of options, but some of those don't seem to work as expected.
But, the things most commonly done do work, and here they are.

Normally one would set a word to the result of the function, as shown
in the examples.  That is because when you want to request a file
name, you want to get your hands on it.  If the operator cancels the
request, the returned result is "none" and the word would be set to
that value.

A plain "request-file" returns a block containing all the file names
selected.  The refinement of "path" returns a block, but the first
item is the folder and the other items are the file names in a relative
form.  

If you want just one file, use the /only refinement.  

If you want the request window to limit the choices only to certain
file types, use the "filter" refinement.

Examples:
    FILE-ID-1: request-file
    print ["FILE-ID-1 is a " type? FILE-ID-1 " value is " FILE-ID-1]
    FILE-ID-2: request-file/only 
    print ["FILE-ID-2 is a " type? FILE-ID-2 " value is " FILE-ID-2] 
    FILE-ID-3: request-file/path
    print ["FILE-ID-3 is " FILE-ID-3]
    FILE-ID-4: request-file/only/filter ["*.txt"]
    print ["FILE-ID-4 is " FILE-ID-4]
    halt

As hinted above, if the operator cancels the request, you have to
take appropriate action because you won't have a file name to work
with.  A common approach would be to check the result of the function
for "none" and then quit the program, or, if you are inside a function,
exit the function, as shown below:
    FILE-ID: request-file/only
    if not FILE-ID [
        alert "No file requested"
        quit ;; or "exit" if inside a function 
    ]

---Request-dir

Similar to request-file is the request-dir function to select a folder.
The result is either a folder name or "none" if the request is canceled.
    FOLDER-ID: request-dir
    either FOLDER-ID [
        print ["Selected folder is " FOLDER-ID]
        halt
    ] [
        alert "No folder selected"
        quit
    ]

---Request-color

The "request-color" function pops up a device with sliders so you can
select a color, visually, and then, when the function exits, it returns
a color tuple for the color you selected.

The function has refinements to control the placement of the device,
and a default color, as shown in the example.  Put this example under
a REBOL header. 
    REQUESTED-COLOR: request-color
    print REQUESTED-COLOR 
    REQUESTED-COLOR: request-color/offset 50x50
    print REQUESTED-COLOR
    REQUESTED-COLOR: request-color/color brick 
    print REQUESTED-COLOR
    REQUESTED-COLOR: request-color/color/offset yellow 200x200 
    print REQUESTED-COLOR  
    halt 

---Request-date

The "request-date" function pops up a little date requestor box like
you probably have seen elsewhere.  When you select a date, the funtion
returns it as a return value.  If you don' select a date, the function
returns "none."  A "offset" refinement lets you position the box somewhere
other than the center of the physical screen.  Try the example under a
REBOL header:
    REQUESTED-DATE: request-date/offset 200x200  
    print REQUESTED-DATE 
    halt 

---Request-text

The "request-text" function is for requesting a small amount of text
from the operator.  An "offset" refinement allows positioning of the
window.  A "title" refinement allows a title on the title bar.
A "default" refinement allows pre-filled text in the field. 
If the operator enters nothing, the function returns "none."
This example shows all the refinements at once:
    REQUESTED-TEXT: request-text/offset/title/default
        200x200
        "Enter text here"
        "Default text"  
    print REQUESTED-TEXT 
    halt 

---Request-pass

The "request-pass" function pops up a window for entering a user ID
and password, which are returned in a two-element block, as shown in 
the example.  There is a "user" refinement to pre-fill the user ID.
There is an "offset" refinement to position the window.  There is a
"title" refinement to load the title bar.  THere is an "only"
refinement to get a password only in which case the function returns
a string instead of a block.  If the operator enters nothing, "none"
is returned.
    CREDENTIALS: request-pass
    print ["CREDENTIALS is a " type? CREDENTIALS]
    print ["User ID is " CREDENTIALS/1]
    print ["Password is "CREDENTIALS/2]
    CREDENTIALS: request-pass/user "defaultuser" 
    print ["CREDENTIALS is a " type? CREDENTIALS]
    print ["User ID is " CREDENTIALS/1]
    print ["Password is "CREDENTIALS/2]
    CREDENTIALS: request-pass/offset/title/only 200x200 "Password for defaultuser" 
    print ["CREDENTIALS is a " type? CREDENTIALS]
    print ["User ID is " CREDENTIALS]
    halt 

\note

The examples above are written in sort of a plodding manner, where
the result of a function is assigned as the value of a word, and then
something is done with that value.  Because of REBOL's structure, where
you have the right-to-left evaluation and functions return values which
go into other functions, these examples, and other code like it, can
be condensed.  If, for example, you want to get a password for a known
user ID, store it, check to see if it was entered, and then take some
other actions, you could code a lot of that in one line:

/note

    either PASSWORD: request-pass/title/only "Password for defaultuser" [
        alert rejoin [
            PASSWORD
            " is correct"
        ] 
    ] [
        alert "No password entered"
    ]

---Request-list

The "request-list" function is for picking one item from a list of
items.  The list of items is provided in a block.  There is an
"offset" refinement to control positioning of the window.
A title for the selection window is required:
    SELECTED-ITEM: request-list/offset 200x200 "Pick an item" [
        "Item 01-01"
        "Item 01-02"
        "Item 01-03"
        "Item 01-04"
        "Item 01-05"
        "Item 01-06"
        "Item 01-07"
        "Item 01-08"
        "Item 01-09"
        "Item 01-10"
        "Item 01-11"
        "Item 01-12"
        "Item 01-13"
        "Item 01-14"
        "Item 01-15"
        "Item 01-16"
        "Item 01-17"
        "Item 01-18"
        "Item 01-19"
        "Item 01-20"
    ]  
    print SELECTED-ITEM
    halt 

---Request-download
 
The "request-download" function reads a file on the internet,
as specified by a URL.  With no refinements, the function will
return the files as a binary data item.  With the "to" refinement
and a file name, the function will store the downloaded file on disk.
    DOWNLOAD-PAGE: request-download http://www.rebol.com/what-rebol.html 
    print ["DOWNLOAD-PAGE is " type? DOWNLOAD-PAGE]
    request-download/to http://www.rebol.com/what-rebol.html %tempsave.html 
    print "Check to see if tempsave.html exists" 
    halt 

---Request

The "request" function brings up various forms of request boxes with
buttons, and whatever the buttons are, the results are the same, 
which is, that a "true," "false," or "none" value is returned, and thus
can be checked with an "if" or "either" function.

The function has an "offset" refinement to control positioning, and then
other refinements that control the number of buttons and the appearance 
of an icon on the window.  The function takes, as an argument, the text
of a message for the request window.  Running through the example is the
best way to see what the results look like.  Notice that for the "type"
refinement, a REBOL "word" is expected.  In other words, it needs that
apostrophe in the front, so that it is not evaluated as a function or
replaced with a value. 
    ANSWER: request "Question 1"
    print ["The answer is " ANSWER] 
    ANSWER: request/offset "Question 2" 200x200
    print ["The answer is " ANSWER] 
    ANSWER: request/ok "Question 3"
    print ["The answer is " ANSWER] 
    ANSWER: request/only "Question 4" 
    print ["The answer is " ANSWER] 
    ANSWER: request/confirm "Question 5" 
    print ["The answer is " ANSWER] 
    ANSWER: request/type "Question 6" 'alert
    print ["The answer is " ANSWER] 
    ANSWER: request/type "Question 7" 'help 
    print ["The answer is " ANSWER] 
    ANSWER: request/type "Question 8" 'info 
    print ["The answer is " ANSWER] 
    ANSWER: request/type "Question 9" 'stop 
    print ["The answer is " ANSWER] 
    halt 

---Flash

The "flash" function is for putting up a message to indicate that
something is happending.  It is the job of the program to use the
"unview" function to close the flash window at the appropriate time.
The "flash" function returns the flash window, so that the program
can flash more than one thing, and then unview them one at a time
by name.  
    flash "Basic flash window; wait three seconds."
    wait 3
    unview
    request/ok "Done with basic flash demo." 
    view layout [ 
        button 200  "Start demo" [
            FLASH-1: flash "Flash 1; drag off center."
            FLASH-2: flash "Flash 2; drag off center"
        ] 
        button 200 "Unview flash 1" [unview FLASH-1]
        button 200 "Unview flash 2" [unview FLASH-2]
        button 200 "Quit" [quit] 
    ]

---Inform, hide-popup

The "inform" function pops up a dialog window of your own creation
(with the layout function) and will not let you do anything else
until you have used the "hide-popup" function to close the window.
The window you show with "inform" is created with the "layout" function
and can be as involved as you like.  This is in contrast to some of the
built-in functions for requesting small amounts of data, where you are
restricted to small amounts of data.  Put the following example under
a REBOL header:
    MODAL-TEXT: ""
    MODAL-WINDOW: layout [
        MODAL-FIELD: field 500
        button "Close" [
            MODAL-TEXT: copy get-face MODAL-FIELD
            hide-popup
        ]
    ]
    view layout [
        button "Get text" [
            inform MODAL-WINDOW
            print MODAL-TEXT
        ]
        button "Quit" [quit] 
    ]

---Load-image

This function appears to be used for bringing into memory one copy
of an image file, so it can be used multiple times without multiple
copies in memory.
    REBOL-LOGO: load-image %reb-logo.gif
    view MAIN-WINDOW: layout [
        label "Copy 1 of the image"
        image REBOL-LOGO
        label "Copy 2 of the image"
        image REBOL-LOGO
        button "Close" [quit]
    ]

---Focus, unfocus

These functions are used for putting the "focus" on a text-entry
field, so that when you start typing, text appears there.
You can focus a specified interface object, but the "unfocus" is
general, in that it removes the focus from whatever currently has it.
Put this under a REBOL header:
    view center-face layout [
        across
        label "FIELD-1"
        FIELD-1: field 100
        return
        label "FIELD-2"
        FIELD-2: field 100
        return
        label "FIELD-3"
        FIELD-3: field 100
        return
        button 150 "Focus FIELD-1" [focus FIELD-1]
        return
        button 150 "Focus FIELD-2" [focus FIELD-2]
        return
        button 150 "Focus FIELD-3" [focus FIELD-3]
        return
        button 150 "Unfocus current" [unfocus] 
        return
        button 150 "Quit" [quit] 
]

---Dump-face

This is a debugging function that provides information about an
interface object.  The argument to the function can be a whole window,
or just some part of a window, as shown (Put under a REBOL header):
    view MAIN-WINDOW: layout [
        BANNER-TEXT: banner "Test window"
        FIELD-1: field 200 "Default text"
        BUTTON-1: button beige 200 "Dummy button"
        button 200 "Dump MAIN-WINDOW" [print dump-face MAIN-WINDOW]
        button 200 "Dump BANNER-TEXT" [print dump-face BANNER-TEXT]
        button 200 "Dump FIELD-1" [print dump-face FIELD-1]
        button 200 "Dump BUTTON-1" [print dump-face BUTTON-1]
        button 200 "Quit" [quit]
    ]

---In-window?

This is a function that can tell, at run time, if some sytle is
located in some window.  This might seem like a strange thing to do,
but remember that because REBOL is an iterpreted language, it is 
possible for a REBOL program to generate windows at run time.
It seems that this function can NOT tell if a a window contains a 
style, only if an existing style is in a window.  In other words,
if you make a window, put a bunch of named styles in it, and then
use the "in-window?" function on a style that does not exist, you
will get an error.  The function only checks to see if an existing
style is in a specified window, not if a style exists in the first
place.  Put this example under a REBOL header:
    MAIN-WINDOW: layout [
        label "BOX-1"
        BOX-1: box 200x200 red "BOX-1" font [align: 'center]
        button 200 tan "View secondary" [view/new SECONDARY-WINDOW]
        button 200 "BOX-1 in MAIN?" [print in-window? MAIN-WINDOW BOX-1]
        button 200 "BOX-1 in SECONDARY?" [print in-window? SECONDARY-WINDOW BOX-1]
        button 200 "BOX-2 in MAIN?" [print in-window? MAIN-WINDOW BOX-2]
        button 200 "BOX-2 in SECONDARY?" [print in-window? SECONDARY-WINDOW BOX-2]
        button 200 "Hide BOX-1" [hide BOX-1]
        button 200 "Hide BOX-2" [hide BOX-2]
        button 200 "Show BOX-1" [show BOX-1]
        button 200 "Show BOX-2" [show BOX-2]
        button 200 "Quit" [quit]
    ]
    SECONDARY-WINDOW: layout [
        label "BOX-2"
        BOX-2: box 200x200 green "BOX-2" font [align: 'center]
        button 200 "Unview me" [unview SECONDARY-WINDOW]
    ]
    view center-face MAIN-WINDOW

---Clear-fields

This is a function that often is used on data-entry windows to clear
out all fields, either after obtaining all fields, or maybe in 
response to a button for clearing fields.  After clearing fields, it 
will be necessary to "show" the window, or you could have a window
with data in fields, but in reality NOT have data in the fields.
    MAIN-WINDOW: layout [
        across
        banner "Data entry form"
        return
        label "FIELD-1"
        FIELD-1: field 400
        return
        label "FIELD-2"
        FIELD-2: field 400
        return
        label "FIELD-3"
        FIELD-3: field 400
        return
        button "Clear" [
            clear-fields MAIN-WINDOW 
            show MAIN-WINDOW
        ]
        button "Submit" [
            print copy get-face FIELD-1
            print copy get-face FIELD-2
            print copy get-face FIELD-3
        ]
        button "Quit" [quit]
    ]
    view center-face MAIN-WINDOW

---Size-text

This is a function for obtaining the size of text inside of some style
that holds text, like a text field or an area.  The function is used
a lot when scrolling text, because one has to know the size of the
text, as well as the size of the style holding the text, to adjust a
scroller to make the text scroll properly.  
    TEST-TEXT: {
    This is a function that often is used on data-entry windows to clear
    out all fields, either after obtaining all fields, or maybe in 
    response to a button for clearing fields.  After clearing fields, it 
    will be necessary to "show" the window, or you could have a window
    with data in fields, but in reality NOT have data in the fields.
    }
    MAIN-WINDOW: layout [
        TEXT-FIELD-1-VALUE: text 200x400 TEST-TEXT
        TEXT-FIELD-1-SIZE: text 100
        TEXT-FIELD-2-VALUE: text 400x200 TEST-TEXT
        TEXT-FIELD-2-SIZE: text 100
        button 200 "Show size 1" [
            set-face TEXT-FIELD-1-SIZE to-string size-text TEXT-FIELD-1-VALUE
        ]
        button 200 "Show size 2" [
            set-face TEXT-FIELD-2-SIZE to-string size-text TEXT-FIELD-2-VALUE 
        ]
        button 200 "Quit" [quit]
    ]
    view center-face MAIN-WINDOW

---Caret-to-offset

This is a specialized function for working with styles that contain text.
It converts an index of a string (remember that a string is a series
and can have an index) to an x-y offset into the style that holds the 
string.  An example from the REBOL function dictionary follows.

Here is a bit of explanation.  In the layout as coded, the box called
"bx" is about the size of one character, and is positioned by default
at the top of the layout window, above "tx" which will hold some text
in a 100x100 area.  But before the window is "viewed" by the last line,
we want to move that box on top of the letter "a" in the word
"example."  How do we do that?  The "at" function applied to the
text value of "tx" (tx/text) with a value of 14 will return the index
into the text string that points to the 14th character, namely, the
letter "a" in "example."  Now we want to convert that index into an
x-y pair that will locate the letter "a" inside the "tx" style. 
Remember now that the offset is going to be an x-y pair in pixels,
which is why we have to apply some conversion to the index of the
text string.  The "caret-to-offset" function provides that conversion,
and returns an x-y pair that points to the letter "a" in the "tx"
style that holds the text.  So now, to position the box, we have to
adjust its offset.  We adjust it to the offset of "tx" PLUS the 
calculated offset of the letter "a."  AFTER we have made that adjustment,
THEN we view the window.  (The documentation notes that you also may do
this kind of thing after the window has been made visible.) 
    out: layout [
        bx: box 10x15 red
        tx: body 100x100
    ]
    tx/text: {This is an example character string.}
    xy: caret-to-offset tx at tx/text 14
    bx/offset: tx/offset + xy
    view out

---Offset-to-caret 

This is a reverse function for caret-to-offset.  It uses the offset 
of a text value in some text style and converts that offset into an
index into the text value, so one can perhaps work with that text
value at that position.  For lack of a better example at this time,
here is one from the REBOL documentation that shows some of the things
that one could do if one wanted to dig into the "draw" dialect.

Here is a bit of explanation. At the top of the window is a small
area of text.  We want to put the mouse on some character of that
text string and obtain the series index into that text, so we could
potentially do something with the text at that point.
It appears that the offset-to-caret function returns not an index
value of the text, but the text itself from the point of the index
value to the end.

The text area ("body") has an activated "look and feel" by the presence
of the "feel" facet and its "engage" function which is activated by 
a mouse click on the area.  The function operates with three things,
which are indicated by the function parameters of "face," "act," and
"event."  If the action is the word "down" which indicates push of the
mouse button, the function takes action.  It appears that the event
itself, that is, the mouse click, has an "offset" facet, which must
be the offset in the text area where the pointer was when the mouse
was clicked.  The offset-to-caret function, when applied to the style
itself (referred to by "face") and the offset of the event (the location 
of the mouse pointer when the mouse was clicked), returns the text 
from that point to the end, and with the "copy" function we load it
into the text facet of "bx" and then re-show bx.
    view layout [
        body 80x50 "This is an example string."
            feel [
                engage: func [face act event] [
                    if act = 'down [
                        bx/text: copy offset-to-caret
                            face event/offset
                        show bx
                    ]
                ]
            ]
        bx: body 80x50 white black
    ]

---scroll-para

This is a function that encapsulates all that must be done to scroll a
text style using a scroller.  One passes to it a text face and a scroller.
    ;;  -- Generate some demo text and load it into the window.
    LOAD-TEXT-FIELD: does [
        DEMO-TEXT: ""
        DEMO-FILE-LIST: read %.
        foreach FILENAME DEMO-FILE-LIST [
            append DEMO-TEXT rejoin [
                to-string FILENAME
                newline
            ]
        ]
        SCROLL-TEXT-LOAD WINDOW-TEXT WINDOW-SCROLLER DEMO-TEXT
        show WINDOW-TEXT
        show WINDOW-SCROLLER
    ]
    ;;  -- Load the text face with text passed to us in TDATA.
    SCROLL-TEXT-LOAD: func [TXT BAR TDATA] [
        TXT/text: TDATA
        TXT/para/scroll/y: 0
        TXT/line-list: none
        TXT/user-data: second size-text TXT
        BAR/data: 0
        BAR/redrag TXT/size/y / TXT/user-data
    ]
    view layout [
        across
        WINDOW-TEXT: text 300x400 as-is
        WINDOW-SCROLLER: scroller 20x400 
            [scroll-para WINDOW-TEXT WINDOW-SCROLLER]
        return
        button "Load text" [LOAD-TEXT-FIELD]
    ]

---Insert-event-func, remove-event-func

These are two functions that are used to create user-defined
functions that respond to GUI events.  The documentation is a 
little sparse.  The following example shows how one might trap
the event of clicking the "close" X in the upper right corner of
a Windows window.  The program creates a function that is invoked
when an event happens, and this function checks to see if the
event is the "close" event that indicates the X is clicked.
If it is the "close" event, the program removes that function it
created and lets the event take place, which then closes the
window.  If the event is not the "close" event, it just lets
the event take place.
    REBOL [
    ]

    CLOSER: insert-event-func [ 
        either event/type = 'close [ 
            if true = request "OK to close?" [
                remove-event-func :CLOSER
            ] 
        ] [
            event
        ] 
    ] 

    view layout [
        box 200x200 red "Click the corner X to demo"
    ]

Note in the above code a little point about REBOL.  In the line to
remove the event function, it removes the function by name, that is,
by the name of CLOSER.  That name must be preceded by a colon to 
indicate that one is referring to the name CLOSER.  Without that colon,
the interpreter would try to evaluate the word CLOSER which would mean
to run the CLOSER function, which would not make sense because the 
CLOSER function is running already.

---Editor

This is not technically a function of REBOL/View, as in something
that you call and that returns a result, but it is a very handy part
of REBOL that you can make use of.

REBOL has a built-in text editor.  If you call it with an argument
of a file name, it will open that file and display it in its editing
window.  If you call it with an argument of "none" it will pop up a
blank editing window.
    editor none

A very handy feature of the editor is that if the file you are editing
is a REBOL program, you can press the F5 key to run the program.

---Browse

Another function that is not really a "view" function but is really
handy is "browse."  This takes the argument of a URL or a file name
(in a format that makes sense, like html), and runs the default web
browser to view it.  This makes it handy to use the web browser for
reporting, since REBOL does not have any native printing capability.
Format a report in html, pop up a browser as a "print preview," and
then use the browser's printing function to print it.
    browse http://www.rebol.com

You can "browse" unexpected things.  If you "browse" a PDF file,
as an example, 
and the default web browser is configured with the propert helper
program to handle a PDF file, it will come up. 

---Launch

This is not officially a "view" function, but has uses in a GUI
program.  If you have a GUI with, for example, a button that you
want to use to open another window, you have a couple choices.
You can use the "view" function to view a new window, and the
new window will replace the old.  You can use "view/new" which will
make a second window.  You could use the "call" function to 
run the interpreter with arguments to run another script.  
OR, you could use "launch" followed by the name of a REBOL script
to run that other script. 

===Hacking around

If you read some of the VID documentation you get the impression that
it is not totally complete.  There are things that can be done, but
how does one discover what those might be if they are not documented?
A certain amount of self-help is needed when working with VID.
For example, documentation on the drop-down does not mention how to
modify a drop-down at run time.  One might strongly suspect that it
could be done.  What is the approach to discovering if it can? 

One way is to use the REBOL help to probe around and see what there
is to be seen.  In the example below, we make a layout that has a
drop-down on it, and gives that drop-down a name.  We use "dd" because
it is short.  In addition to the drop-down, we have a button that will
execute the "halt" function to bring us to a command prompt, so we
can look around.  

    REBOL []
    
    view layout [
        dd: drop-down 200 data ["aaa" "bbb" "ccc"]
        button "Debug" [halt]
    ]

Run the script and click the button and you get a command prompt.

Use the command "help dd" or "? dd" and you will get the following:

    >> ? dd
    DD is an object of value:
       type            word!     face
       offset          pair!     20x20
       size            pair!     200x24
       span            none!     none

What would you do with the above information?  You would use your experience
with other REBOL functions, your imagination, and some sample scripts you
would write, and you would discover things.  

For example, you might spot the item called "list-data" and see that it
has a lengh of 3.  "list-data" is a very suggestive name, and the length
of 3 is the same as the size of the list in your script.  So you might
do this:

    >> ? dd/list-data
    DD/LIST-DATA is a block of value: ["aaa" "bbb" "ccc"]
    >>

This shows where the values are, and so you might then write a sample
script to modify list-data and see what happens.  Or try it at the
command line:

    >> dd/list-data: "ddd"
    == "ddd"

And then check the result:

    >> ? dd/list-data
    DD/LIST-DATA is a string of value: "ddd"
    >>

You might try the above concept in a script, and you might discover
that it is not quite working.  Maybe you change the list-data but
it doesn't seem to totally change.  So then you might spot the "reset" 
function and wonder if that is relevant.  You might try using the
"reset" function before changing list-data values and discover that
things finally work as desired.  

A process like the one outlined above is something you might have to
do when using VID because VID seems to be sort of frozen in time and
that now is the only way to find out all it can do.

If you like to get your hands dirty so to speak, there is a keyword
"with" that can be used to modify the various items in a face.  
What you can modify safely, and what will break, is something you
would have to discover on your own.  The "with" keyword will let you 
modify things as you create layouts, but those changes might or might
not be overwritten when the layout is generated, depending on just
how a layout is generated.  The following example gives the idea.
Thanks to Chris on rebolforum for the sample.

    REBOL []
    view layout [ 
         box with [color: red size: 200x100] 
         box green 50x100 with [color: red size: 200x100] 
         box with [color: red] blue 
    ]  

Another thing you can do that could turn up useful information is 
capture the source code for styles and examine it.  The script below
will capture the source in text file for all styles and put those
files in a folder of our choosing.  You then can examine each with
any text editor.

    REBOL [
        Title: "Extract code for all VID styles"
    ]

    ;; [ This is a little utility program for extracting the code behind all the   ]

    ]

        CODE-FILENAME: to-file rejoin [
            to-string STYLE-WORD
            ".txt"
        ]
        write CODE-FILENAME STYLE-CODE
    ]
    alert rejoin [
        "Code files created in " 
        CODE-DIR
    ]
    
===Some common operations 

This section shows some little things harvested from various
places.  They show some practical uses of VID, or maybe how to do
something tricky, or maybe something you wouldn't immediately think
of doing.  But here is a question you should ask yourself.

VID provides default sizing and spacing and coloring for its various
styles.  All those can be changed.  You have a lot of freedom to change
how things look.  But the question is, is it worth it?

Another very useful feature of VID is that it is very quick to whip up
a window for some use, taking the default sizing and spacing and
coloring.  It is more valuable to you to be able to create a useful 
application quickly, or is it more valuable to fuss and tweak interminably
to get the appearance just-so?  If you look around on the internet,
you might run into comments about REBOL that its interface looks "dated"
and that it doesn't do menus, and other comments about its age.
REBOL 2 is indeed frozen, it seems, but it still does what it does, 
and the ability to make a useful application quickly might be, for
some people, a worthwhile trade-off for an appearance that some might
call "better" only because it looks more like what is currently 
fashionable. "Different" is "better" only if it is better, not just
because it is different. 

---Putting a clock on a window

Sometimes it is a nice touch to put a clock on a window.  
The code for that is a handful of lines and shows how to use the
"rate" facet and the "feel" facet.
    REBOL [
        Title: "VID test harness"
    ]

    view layout [
        MAIN-TIME: h1 100 red black (to string! now/time) 
            rate 1                            
            feel [
                engage: [                     
                    MAIN-TIME/text: now/time          
                    show MAIN-TIME
                ]
            ]          
    ]

---Basic data entry

A very common thing to do with a computer is to collect some data
and do something with it.  That could be one of the first things 
a person thinks of when learning a programming language.  
"OK, I understand that I can make a window with all these things
in it, but now what do I actually DO to get something useful done?"

The example below shows one useful thing, namely, getting input from
an operator and doing something with it.  The example just feeds it
back.  Normally one would do more, but you can see in the example 
that the data from the window is available in some "variables"
(WS-FIELD-1, etc.), so from that point you could do other stuff.

The example is laid out in one particular way, but that is not
the "right" way or the only way.  It just a "way" that is helpful
to the author for keeping things organized.  Notice for example that
the field labels in the window have a standard prefix.  That helps
identify items when they are used elsewhere in a large program.
Notice that the actions for the buttons are encapsulated in functions,
and the action block for a button is just a function call.
It would not have to be that way, that is, the code could all be
in-line in the layout, but the function calls make things tidy.

Another thing that is not required is the pseudo-declarations of
WS-FIELD-1 etc.  You could just refer to MAIN-FIELD-1/text wherever
you wanted to.  Or, if you did want WS-FIELD-1, you still would not
have to pseudo-declare it by setting an initial value.
Doing so is just a personal preference.  But, one thing it does
accomplish is that by grabbing window data and putting it into 
WS-FIELD-1 etc., WS-FIELD-1 et al are global words that can be
"probed" with the "probe" command at a command prompt if the program
crashes, or at the command prompt that would become available if
you clicked the "Halt" button.  

In other words, the example is laid out in a rather plodding manner
by design.

---Get a valid date in a field

A common field on a form is a date.  
If you let people enter dates as they like, you have many possible
formats, and so you have to write code to make sense of the input
and reformat it to some standard form, like a REBOL-compatible date
or maybe YYYYMMDD.  Here are some options for using the request-date
function to make sure a field of date input is consistent.

Note that the date "field" is an "info" style so that direct input
is not possible.  The way to get a date is to left-click the info field 
which activates the request-date function and the fills in the field 
for you. 

To test this script, copy the whole thing to a file on your computer
and run it, since it includes the REBOL header. 

Note also the code to request a date and put it into YYYYMMDD format.
It uses the "year," "month," and "day" refinements to get the year,
month, and day.  But, REBOL will return those items as single digits
if the value is less than ten.  So to make sure we have two digits
for the month and day, we reverse the number, add a zero to the end,
reverse it again, and copy off the first two digits. That might be a
clumsy way.  Studying the REBOL documentation might turn up something
better.

---Scrolling a text field

Scrolling through things that don't fit in a window is a very common
thing to do.  Here is an example of scrolling a big text field.
It would take very little work to modify this example for a 
general-purpose text viewer.  

    REBOL [
        Title: "Scrolling a text field"
    ]

    TEXT-DATA: {SCROLLING A TEXT FIELD
                 
    This is a scroller demo from the REBOL cookbook, with annotations to      
    describe some of the obscure points.                                      
                                                                           
    The key understanding is that TEXT-WINDOW it an interface object, and its text 
    value can be envisioned as a rectangle of pixels, with the text "displayed" on   
    it.                                                                        
                                                                           
    Only a part shows through the window. The para/scroll/y value shows the    
    starting point from which text is displayed. This value starts at zero when 
    the text is displayed at the top, and "increases" in a negative direction  
    because the text area can be envisioned as a grid with the top left corner 
    being 0x0--thus "down" the text would be in a negative y direction like    
    the coordinates in algebra. The display window also is a rectangle of      
    pixels, and displaying in it starts at 0x0.                                
                                                                           
    The size/y value is the vertical size of the text window. The user-data     
    value is the vertical size of the text. The (user-data minus size/y)       
    expression is evaluated first. The result of that calculation represents   
    a point in the text value somewhere back from the maximum value, that is,  
    back from the end. That point, back from the end, is back by a distance    
    equal to the size of the display window. In other words, it is the point   
    in the text value where, if the text is displayed from that point forward, 
    you will hit the end of the text when you hit the end of the window. In    
    other words, it is the point where you start to display text when you are  
    displaying the last page.                                                   
                                                                           
    The para/scroll/y value is going to vary from zero (the top of the text)   
    to the result of the above calculation (the last page), as you operate     
    the scroller. That is why the (user-data minus size/y) result is           
    multiplied by the data value of the scroller (which is a fraction in       
    the range of zero to one). Somewhere in that range of zero through         
    (user-data minus size/y) is where we want to start displaying a window     
    of text.                                                                   
                                                                           
    The reason for the max function is that it could happen that the text      
    is SMALLER than the window. In that case, (user-data minus size/y) will    
    be negative (and will be negated later giving a positive value), and we    
    don't want that. Instead, we want to display from the top all the time,    
    and thus want para/scroll/y to be zero.                                    
                                                                           
    We negate the para/scroll/y value because we are going "down" the           
    text in a negative y direction. 

    In this example, we have a separate function to load the text into
    the viewing window.  The reason for this is to show that this function
    could be generalized and the viewing window could be reloaded with
    a second batch of text, and to show what data items must be set up
    to make the scrolling work.  There are a few things that must be done,
    and they don't jump out of the regular VID documentation.

    When we load a fresh batch of text, we set the para/scroll/y value
    to zero so that when we do the first "show" of the text we are at
    the top.

    When we load a fresh batch of text, we set the "data" facet of the
    scroller to zero to position it at the top.

    When we load fresh text, the line-list must be set to none.

    We store, in the user-data facet of the text area, the "y" size of
    the text in the text area.  That is what the "size-text" function does,
    it gets the size of the text that is in a text field.  We use the
    "second" function because the size is a "pair" and the second part
    of the pair is the "y" dimension.

    The "TEXT-SCROLLER/redrag..." line sets the size of the little thing
    that you grab and move in the scroller.  It must be sized appropriately
    so it looks correct for the size of the text relative to the size of
    the window.  The size/y item is the "y" size of the text window.
    The user-data facet holds the "y" size of the whole chunk of text
    in the text field.  Dividing the visible size by the total size gives
    a result that is used to set the size of the scroll thing. 
    (We are not exactly sure what is going on here.)

    Another point to note about this example is how the TEXT-WINDOW and
    TEXT-SCROLLER are objects in the layout, and they are passed as
    arguments to the TEXT-SCROLL function.  You would not have to do it
    that way, but it is interesting that you can.  That means that you 
    could in theory write a general scrolling procedure for any text field.

---Scrolling a layout

Text is not the only thing that can be scrolled.  
With REBOL you can make sub-layouts, and they can be scrolled.
This opens up interesting possibilities for windows that are too long
to fit on a physical monitor.  The following example was harvested
from the internet, so the notes about how it works are comments in
the code.

    ;; [ The answer is that the offset will be negative.  A negative number        ]
    ;; [ for the offset/y means that the display will start at some place          ]
    ;; [ above the box.  How far above the box?  Far enough so that the last       ]
    ;; [ line of the data will be at the bottom of the box.  How far is that?      ]
    ;; [ The answer is that it is an amount that is the difference between         ]
    ;; [ the size of the stuff you want to show and the space you have to show it. ]
    ;; [ In the above example, you have 20 lines you want to show, but only        ]
    ;; [ 12 lines to show it, so 20 minus 12 gives 8, which means that if you      ]
    ;; [ show the pane with an offset of negative 8, it will fall into the         ]
    ;; [ container such that line 20 of the data is at line 12 of the box.         ]

    ;; [ The above is concept is very important.  When you scroll the box,         ]
    ;; [ the offset/y of the pane is going to vary from zero to a number that      ]
    ;; [ is the amount by which the data overflows the container.  If the data     ]
    ;; [ is smaller than the container, we want no scrolling to take place,        ]

    ;; [ So where does the scroller fit into this?  The scroller varies from       ]
    ;; [ zero to one.  It is a fraction.  It is the fractional amount of that      ]

    ;; [ "travel" in that scroller is 8.  Eight is the amount that won't fit       ]
    ;; [ in the visible container.  Eight is the highest amount we will have       ]
    ;; [ to scroll, and a negative eight is the highest offset we will need        ]

    ;; [ that fractional value to that maximimum possible offset to get the        ]

---Embedding an image

As indicated earlier, you can put an image in a window by using the 
keyword "image" to specify an image, followed by a file name to identify
a file that contains the image.  There is another way to put an image
on a window, and it is handy for something like a logo that always is
present, or for a demo where you want everyting in one file, or some
other similar situation.  

There are a couple ways you could approach this, but here is one way.
First, make yourself a little toolbox of utilities, and include the
following function.  This function reads a specified image file and
converts it to base 64 encoding.  It puts the resulting string on the
clipboard.  
    IMAGE-STRING: does [
        system/options/binary-base: 64
        IMAGESTRING-FILE: request-file/only
        if not IMAGESTRING-FILE [
            alert "No file specified"
            exit
        ]
        IMAGESTRING-STRING: read/binary IMAGESTRING-FILE
        save clipboard:// IMAGESTRING-STRING
        alert "Hex representation of image is on the clipboard"
    ]

Then, in some script you would write, execute the above function 
as follows, which will result in a hex representation of a graphic
file put on the clipboard.
    IMAGE-STRING

Now, in the program where you want the embedded image, pick a name for
the image and put it on a line of code.  This example uses the REBOL logo,
so we will pick a name of REBOL-LOGO.  Code it like this, and press the
enter key after the "load."
    REBOL-LOGO: load

Finally, copy the clipboard.  In windows, press the CTRL-V key.
The result will look like this:
    REBOL-LOGO: load

Now, when you make a layout, you can embed the REBOL logo with this
line:

    image REBOL-LOGO

---Getting all file names of a particular type

Sometimes you might want to do something to all files of a particular
type in a particular folder.  Maybe you want to find all image files
for viewing, or all text files for some sort of processing.
Here is an example of how to do that. 
The procedure requests a folder name, then reads all the file names
in that folder, resulting in a block, then goes through that block
removing all file names that are not of the desired type.

The "print" at the end is just for demo purposes.  Normally, one
would create the list of files and do something with it besides
just print it.
    IMAGE-FILE?: func ["Returns true if file is an image" FILE-ID] [
        find [%.bmp %.jpg %.jpeg %.gif %.png] find/last FILE-ID "."
    ]
    REQUESTED-FOLDER: request-dir
    if not REQUESTED-FOLDER [
        quit     
    ]
    FILE-LIST: read REQUESTED-FOLDER/.  
    while [not tail? FILE-LIST] [
        either IMAGE-FILE? first FILE-LIST [ ;; always check the first one
            FILE-LIST: next FILE-LIST  ;; if an image, move on to the next one
        ] [
            remove FILE-LIST           ;; otherwise remove the non-image file
        ]
    ]
    FILE-LIST: head FILE-LIST  ;; return the list at the head
    if empty? FILE-LIST [
        inform layout [backdrop 140.0.0 text bold "No images found"]
        quit  
    ]
    ;; Show the results for demo purposes

---Using the clipboard

REBOL seems to have limited access to the Windows clipboard.
It appears that one can read and write only text to the clipboard.
Here is a demo that shows how to reference the clipboard, and is a useful
little program also.  It was used in the preparation of this document to
capture scripts and put them into this document with the indentation at
the front of each line that marks them as code.  The script would be
run after loading the clipboard with lines of code, and the result of
running the script would be that the clipboard is loaded with those same
lines of code, but each line has four spaces in front.  
Adding the spaces is accomplished by replacing each line terminator
with the line terminator plus four spaces (which would go on the next
line since they are after the line terminator), and then, to take care
of the first line which is not preceded by a line terminator, inserting
four spaces at the front of the data.  Inserting works because the stuff
on the clipboard is a string, and a string is a variety of a series, and
the insert function works on a series.
    REBOL [
    ]
    
    TEMP-LINES: read clipboard://
    
    insert/dup TEMP-LINES " " 4
    
    replace/all TEMP-LINES newline rejoin [newline "    "]
    
    write clipboard:// TEMP-LINES
    
    alert "Clipboard loaded" 

---Playing a sound and showing progress

This is a heavily-annotated script that shows a use of the progress bar
to show how long a sound file has been playing.  It is a pretty big program
just to demo a progress bar, but it's a fun little demo that could be
generalized.

---Playing an alert sound

The highlight of the above example was the progress bar that accompanied
the sound.  Here is a demo of a program to play one sound.  The program
works on a Windows computer.  It locates the folder of system sounds, 
provides a list, and lets you click on the different sounds to hear them.
The script includes a function that is called for each sound, so you may
copy out that one function and include it in another program.
Then you could provide your own block of sound file names to play, and
play an appropriate one at an appropriate time.

Note one thing about the example.  If you try to play sounds too rapidly,
the program will crash.  It seems to have to wait for one sound to play
before playing another.  Click through the sounds slowly and it works.
Click too quickly and it crashes.  This would not be a problem in the
expected use scenario, where you play a short sound in response to something
like a button click. There is documentation about using sound on the REBOL
web site in the section about the Software Development Kit.  The sound
capability used to be available only in the paid version of REBOL, but it
was moved to the free version when development stopped.

---Playing a key click sound

This is another variation of the sound-playing demos.
It is a function that plays a sound hard-coded into the function.
The sound was recorded from a spring-operated keyboard, and the
original purpose of this function was to provide audible feedback
on a window full of buttonw.  One would paste this module into a
program, or, if it is saved as a separate file, "do" the module at
the beginning of a program, and then, when one wanted a click sound,
one would code:
    attempt [CLICK]

The use of the "attempt" function allows the program to continue
if the sound can't play for some reason.

The canned sound could be replaced by any sound of your choosing,
by converting the sound file to base-64 as explained elsewhere.

    ;; [ start recording, press the key, and quit recording.                       ]
    ;; [ The way to use this procedure is to code the following as part of the     ]

---Changing languages

This somewhat lengthy demo shows one nice feature of an interpreted
language, namely, the ability to modify itself.  

There will be three files in this demo.  One will be the demo script.
This program will load, by means of the "do" function, a file that
contains all the text for its window.  Then, when the program makes
its window with the "layout" function, it will obtain all text for
the window from that loaded "language" file.  Nothing spectacular
there, BUT, the program has a button that will allow the operator to
RELOAD a DIFFERENT language file, and remake the window with new
text in a different language, all at run time.  In other words, no
restarting, no re-installing, no re-configuring.  The three files
follow.  The language files have extensive comments. 

Save this file under any name of your choosing.

    ;              ==============================
    ;
    ; This module is loaded into another script with the "do"
    ; command somewhere near the beginning of the script.  It contains
    ; all screen text, button legends, messages, absolutely any text
    ; that appears anywhere in the application.  Each little piece of
    ; text is identified by a data name.
    ;
    ; The purpose of this module is to gather all text for an
    ; application into this one place.  With all the text in one
    ; place, the operation of porting the application to a different
    ; human language can be accomplished by translating this file,
    ; and only this file.
    ;
    ; The various kinds of text fragments are grouped together,
    ; just for ease of use.  The words that refer to the text
    ; fragments follow a naming convention, once again just for
    ; ease of use.  The words could be anything, but of course
    ; many other modules might refer to these names. 
    ;
    ; These are the text groupings:
    ;
    ;     Button text:    What is printed on buttons
    ;     Screen text:    Little text fragments that could appear
    ;                     anywhere in a script
    ;     Message text:   One-line messages to show in alert boxes
    ;     Message detail: Multi-line messages.
    ;     Help screens:   Larger screens that can be displayed as help.
    ;
    ; Each "message text" line is expected to have a matching "message
    ; detail" multi-line message.  The idea behind this is that
    ; if an operator gets a message in an alert box, he can ask
    ; for a more detailed message.
    ;
    ; The names of the text fragments have the following form.
    ;
    ;     XXX-999
    ;
    ; where XXX shows what kind of text it is:
    ;
    ;     LMB: Language Module Button text
    ;     LMT: Language Module Text fragment
    ;     LMM: Language Module Message
    ;     LMD: Language Module Detailed message
    ;     LMH: Language Module Help screen
    ;
    ; and 999 is a number.  Note again that each LMM piece of
    ; text is a one-line messsage, and each will have a matching
    ; LMD message.  By "matching" we mean that LMM-001 will have
    ; a corresponding detail message called LMD-001, and so on.
    ;
    ; *IN ADDITION* to the text strings and messages, this module
    ; contains an illustrative function that uses the text strings
    ; and messages so you can see how they work.  Calling the
    ; function LM-ALERT with a three digit number as a string,
    ; in this way:
    ;
    ;     LM-ALERT "nnn"
    ;
    ; will pop up an alert box with a message and two buttons.
    ; The message will be LMM-nnn, and the buttons will be one
    ; for OK and one for DETAILS.  Clicking OK will close the alert.
    ; Clicking DETAILS will pop up another alert with an expanded
    ; message, LMD-nnn.  Clicking OK on this second alert box
    ; will exit the function.
    ;
    ; Notice how the values of the buttons are data names, and
    ; the texts of the messages are pulled out of data items.
    ; This shows that if an application could be coded to get
    ; all text from this file, then the application could be
    ; moved to another language just by translating this file.

    ; This module is loaded into another script with the "do"
    ; command somewhere near the beginning of the script.  It contains
    ; all screen text, button legends, messages, absolutely any text
    ; that appears anywhere in the application.  Each little piece of
    ; text is identified by a data name.
    ;
    ; The purpose of this module is to gather all text for an
    ; application into this one place.  With all the text in one
    ; place, the operation of porting the application to a different
    ; human language can be accomplished by translating this file,
    ; and only this file.
    ;
    ; The various kinds of text fragments are grouped together,
    ; just for ease of use.  The words that refer to the text
    ; fragments follow a naming convention, once again just for
    ; ease of use.  The words could be anything, but of course
    ; many other modules might refer to these names. 
    ;
    ; These are the text groupings:
    ;
    ;     Button text:    What is printed on buttons
    ;     Screen text:    Little text fragments that could appear
    ;                     anywhere in a script
    ;     Message text:   One-line messages to show in alert boxes
    ;     Message detail: Multi-line messages.
    ;     Help screens:   Larger screens that can be displayed as help.
    ;
    ; Each "message text" line is expected to have a matching "message
    ; detail" multi-line message.  The idea behind this is that
    ; if an operator gets a message in an alert box, he can ask
    ; for a more detailed message.
    ;
    ; The names of the text fragments have the following form.
    ;
    ;     XXX-999
    ;
    ; where XXX shows what kind of text it is:
    ;
    ;     LMB: Language Module Button text
    ;     LMT: Language Module Text fragment
    ;     LMM: Language Module Message
    ;     LMD: Language Module Detailed message
    ;     LMH: Language Module Help screen
    ;
    ; and 999 is a number.  Note again that each LMM piece of
    ; text is a one-line messsage, and each will have a matching
    ; LMD message.  By "matching" we mean that LMM-001 will have
    ; a corresponding detail message called LMD-001, and so on.
    ;
    ; *IN ADDITION* to the text strings and messages, this module
    ; contains an illustrative function that uses the text strings
    ; and messages so you can see how they work.  Calling the
    ; function LM-ALERT with a three digit number as a string,
    ; in this way:
    ;
    ;     LM-ALERT "nnn"
    ;
    ; will pop up an alert box with a message and two buttons.
    ; The message will be LMM-nnn, and the buttons will be one
    ; for OK and one for DETAILS.  Clicking OK will close the alert.
    ; Clicking DETAILS will pop up another alert with an expanded
    ; message, LMD-nnn.  Clicking OK on this second alert box
    ; will exit the function.
    ;
    ; Notice how the values of the buttons are data names, and
    ; the texts of the messages are pulled out of data items.
    ; This shows that if an application could be coded to get
    ; all text from this file, then the application could be
    ; moved to another language just by translating this file.

---Saving the window position

Lots of programs that show windows will show its window in the location on
the screen where the window was when the program last quit.  REBOL can do
that by accessing the "offset" of a window and saving it in a file, and
then loading that file at BOJ and using the saved offset in the "layout"
function.  The example below shows that.  By the way, if you have a double
monitor setup and drag the window to the second monitor before quitting,
the window will be deformed when you run the program again.  You could 
fix that by making sure that the location you save does not start outside
the screen boundaries, and resetting the last location to some default
value if it is.  The screen size seems to be in the system object in 
system/view/screen-face/size.    

    REBOL [
        Title: "VID test harness"
    ]

    LAST-LOC-FILE: %last-location.txt 
    LAST-LOC: 20X20  ;; Default offset in case this is the first run.

        print ["I am at " MAIN-WINDOW/offset]

        save LAST-LOC-FILE LAST-LOC 
        quit
    ] 

    ;; If this is the first run, the saved location file will not exist.
    if exists? LAST-LOC-FILE [
        LAST-LOC: load LAST-LOC-FILE
    ]

    MAIN-WINDOW: layout/offset [
        banner "Find my location"
        button 200 "Where am I" [WHERE-AM-I]
        button 200 "Quit" [QUIT-BUTTON]
        button 200 "Debug" [halt] 
    ] LAST-LOC

    view MAIN-WINDOW  

---Generating VID

One of the neat features of an interpreted langage is that a program
can generate parts of itself.  In this example, we have a function 
that takes a block of data and then generates its own VID code to
display that data in a grid of "info" fields.  

This is based on an idea in Nick Antonaccio's document for creating    
business applications at:                                               
http://business-programming.com/business_programming.html               
The goal is to create a function that could be fed the results of an    
SQL query and poof!...up would pop a grid containing the data items     
from the query.                                                         
The result of an SQL query is a block of blocks, and each sub-block     
contains the data items from one row of the query.                      
The way this works is to generate VID code where each item of the       
input data has its own field on a VID layout.                           
Note the double loop.  For each sub-block of input, we generate a row   
of data fields.  For each item in the sub-block, we generate one info   
field on that row.                                                      
This was designed for quick-and-dirty viewing of small queries.         
It appears that the "info" style has a certain default size,            
and a query that produces many columns could waste a lot of horizontal  
space if every column got the default size.  To "fix" that the          
function takes a second block which is a list of column widths in       
pixels for each column of a data sub-block.  It is the job of the       
caller to make sure this block of columns sizes has the same number     
of items as the data sub-blocks, and the column widths are big enough.  
This module really should be an object, but we had a bit of trouble     
when we had it as an object and used a second similar module for        
a second similar layout.  The scroll bars were not scrolling their      
intended grids.  That problem seemed to get solved when every word
in the function was unique and not in conflict with any other word
in the second module.  That is why all the words below have the GLO
prefix.

    GLO-BOXHEIGHT: 500 
    GLO-BOXWIDTH: 0
    GLO-BOXSIZE: none 

    GLO-LAYOUT: func [
        GLOBLOCK
        GLOWIDTHS
        /local GLOGRID GLODISP GLOCOL
    ] [
        GLO-BOXWIDTH: 0
        foreach WIDTH GLOWIDTHS [
            GLO-BOXWIDTH: GLO-BOXWIDTH + WIDTH
        ]
        GLO-BOXSIZE: to-pair reduce [GLO-BOXWIDTH GLO-BOXHEIGHT] 
        GLOGRID: copy [across space 0]
        foreach BLK GLOBLOCK [
            GLOCOL: 0 
            foreach COL BLK [
                GLOCOL: GLOCOL + 1
                append GLOGRID compose [
                    info (pick GLOWIDTHS GLOCOL) (form COL)
                ]
             ]
             append GLOGRID compose [return]
        ]
        GLODISP: layout/tight [
            across
            GLOBOX: box GLO-BOXSIZE with [ ;; "with" lets us get at internals
                pane: layout/tight GLOGRID pane/offset: 0x0
            ]
            scroller to-pair reduce [20 second GLO-BOXSIZE] [
                GLOBOX/pane/offset/y: GLOBOX/size/y - GLOBOX/pane/size/y * value
                show GLOBOX
            ]
        ]
        return GLODISP
    ]                      
 
===Appetizers

REBOL/View is the version of REBOL that has the GUI capability.
VID, the Video Interface Dialect, is a mini-language that makes is easy to
make windows.  VID is part of REBOL/VIew.  Also part of REBOL/View is all
the functions that help work with windows created with VID.  All the
functions of REBOL/Core also are part of REBOL/View, so you can use the
REBOL/Core functions to work with data obtained from VID windows.
All these parts make it easy to use REBOL/View for making programs for
getting data from windows, doing stuff with it, storing it on disk, and
so one.

But there's more.  The information in this document is limited enough that
one might read it and get a limited idea of what REBOL can do.  To try to
offset that, we present below links to some interesting REBOL programs,
modules, demos, and such that will hint at capabilities that are not obvious
from just the above lists of styles and functions.  This is not any sort of
complete list of anything.  It is little appetizers.  It is things that
might make you think, "That's interesting; I didn't know REBOL could 
do THAT."  

---List-view: enhanced list style

This is a module that you could incorporate into your own program that
does what the "list" style does, but more.  It is interesting because it is
freely available and you may use it, and because it shows a REBOL style
written in REBOL itself.  In fact, a lot of REBOL is written in REBOL
itself.  I think that was one of its design goals, to have a minimum
amount of native functions and then build the rest of REBOL on top of those
for the sake of portability.   

<a href="http://www.rebol.org/view-script.r?script=list-view.r">
list-view.r</a>

---Area-scroll-style: enhanced area style

This is a module, with a built-in demo, that provides a new and improved
"area" style with vertical and horizontal scrollers.  This is another
example of a style created in REBOL itself.

<a href="http://www.rebol.org/view-script.r?script=area-scroll-style.r">
area-scroll-style.r</a>

---Layout-1.8.r:  GUI layout builder

This is a demo of a VID program for making VID layouts.  It is interesting
because it shows that one can do that, but also because of the look of the
operating window, which show that one can get nice results with a little
bit of work.  This script was written by the author of REBOL, so it shows
the language as she should be spoken.

---Gui-crud-app-builder.r:  GUI program generator

This is another idea for using a View program to generate another VIEW
program.

---Toolt4vid.r:  Tool tips

This is a demo of how one can make the "tool tips" which are those annoying
help boxes that pop up when you move the mouse over something.  
This is interesting because it uses the "feel" facet to put some more life
into a window, showing that such things can be done.

---Easy-vid.r: VID documenting itself

This is a script by the creator of REBOL that shows a window of VID
documentation.  It is interesting for that reason alone, but also for how
it shows example code, and that example code can be clicked to make it run.
How cool is that.  Also, because it was written by the Creator himself,
is another example of proper REBOL style.

---Rebolusers.r:  More than just data entry

This is a demo that shows how REBOL can do more than just make data
entry forms with blue buttons.  If you run this demo, it will download
a bunch of pictures and a file of music, and then play the music while 
displaying the pictures.

\note The point being made is...

The point of the above links is to show a contrast with the documentation
that came before.  The documentation that came before showed the
graphical elements that can be put together to make a graphical interface
window.  If you stop there, you might think that graphical windows full
of styles is ALL that REBOL/View can do, and you might not look to REBOL
to solve other kinds of problems.  When you run into other kinds of problems,
you should not automatically assume that REBOL can't handle them.
The handful of examples above are meant to show that there is more to REBOL.
